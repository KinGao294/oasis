Even Open AI is like that, [music] right? I mean, they they crawled the entire web without permission. You could argue that that's fair use or you could argue [music] it's like massive copyright theft. I remember talking to the Lyft founders the week before they launched Lyft [music] and they were extremely worried that they would go to jail and they decided to like roll the dice and launch this thing anyway. I think a big reason why other people didn't launch Lyft and Uber before [music] was literally that it's like it was basically illegal to do that and they were worried that they would go to jail. [music] >> What's funny now is uh it does seem like the world will sort of change the laws as it were. If it turns [music] out that the end user, the end consumer wins by that much. Finding laws that were written in a time before some big tech shift that [music] changes everything and just don't reflect reality can be really valuable.",
