  "full_text": "- The following is a conversation\nwith David Kirtley, a nuclear engineer, expert on nuclear\nfusion, and the CEO of Helion Energy, a company working\non building nuclear fusion reactors and have made incredible\nprogress in a short period of time that make it seem possible, like\nwe could actually get there as a civilization. This is\nexciting because nuclear fusion, if achieved commercially,\nwill solve most of our energy needs in a clean, safe way,\nproviding virtually unlimited clean electricity. The problem is\nthat fusion is incredibly difficult to achieve. You need\nto heat hydrogen to over 100 million degrees Celsius and\ncontain it long enough for atoms to fuse. That's why the\njoke in the past has been that fusion is 30 years\naway and always will be. Just in case you're\nnot familiar, let me clarify the difference between\nnuclear fusion and nuclear fission. By the way, I believe according\nto the excellent subreddit post by pmgoodbeer on this, the\npreferred pronunciation of the latter in the US\nis nuclear fission, like vision. And in the UK and other\ncountries is nuclear fission, like mission. I prefer the nuclear\nfission pronunciation because America. So today's nuclear power plants use nuclear fission.\nThey split apart heavy uranium atoms to release energy.\nFusion does the opposite. It combines light hydrogen atoms\ntogether, the same reaction that powers the Sun and the\nstars. The result is that it's clean fuel from water, no\nlong-lived radioactive waste, inherently safe because a fusion\nreactor can't melt down. If something goes wrong, the reactor\nsimply stops. And there's no carbon emissions. On\na more technical side, Helion uses a different\napproach to fusion than has traditionally been done. Most\nfusion efforts have used tokamaks, which are these giant\ndonut-shaped magnetic containment chambers. Helion uses\npulsed magnetoinertial fusion. David gets into\nthe super technical physics and engineering details\nin this episode, which was fun and fascinating. I\nthink it's important to remember that for all of\nhuman history, we've been limited by energy scarcity.\nAnd every major leap in civilization, agriculture,\nindustrialization, information age, came in part from\nunlocking new energy sources. If someone is\nable to solve commercial fusion, we would enter a new\nera of energy abundance that fundamentally changes what's possible\nfor us humans. I'm excited for the future, and I'm excited for super\ntechnical physics podcast episodes. This is a Lex Fridman podcast. To support\nit, please check out our sponsors in the description where you can also\nfind links to contact me, ask questions, give feedback,\nand so on. And now, dear friends, here's David Kirtley. Let's start\nwith the big picture. What is nuclear fusion, and maybe what is nuclear\nfission? Let's lay out the basics. - So fusion is what powers the\nuniverse. Fusion is what happens in stars and it's where the\nvast amount of energy that we use today here on Earth\ncomes from the process of fusion. It also is what\npowers plants. And those plants become oil, and those\nbecome fossil fuels that then powers the rest of\nhuman civilization for the last 100 years. And so fusion really\nunderpins a lot of what has enabled us as humans to go forward.\nHowever, ironically, we don't do it actively here on\nEarth to make electricity yet. And so fundamentally,\nwhat fusion is, is taking the most common elements in the\nuniverse: hydrogen and lightweight isotopes of hydrogen and helium,\nand fusing those together to make heavier elements.\nIn that process, as you combine atomic nuclei and\nform heavier nuclei, those nuclei are slightly lighter\nthan the sum of the parts. And that comes from a lot of\nthe details of quantum mechanics and how those fundamental\nparticles combine and interact. We also talk about the strong\nnuclear force that holds the atomic nuclei together as one of\nthe fundamental forces involved in fusion. But that mass defect, E=MC²,\nwe know from Einstein, is also energy. And so, in that process,\na tremendous amount of energy is released. And the actual reactions, I think,\nis a lot more interesting than simply it's a little bit lighter, and therefore, energy\nis released. But that's the fundamental process in fusion as you're\nbringing those lightweight atomic nuclei, those isotopes\ntogether. Fission is the exact opposite, where you're taking the\nheaviest elements in the universe: uranium, plutonium, things\nthat are so heavy and have so many internal protons and neutrons\nand electrons, that they're barely held together at all.\nThey're fundamentally unstable or radioactive, and those elements\nare very close to falling apart. And as they do that,\nif you take a uranium 235 or a plutonium 239\nnucleus, and you add something new, usually it's a\nneutron, a sub-atomic particle that's uncharged, that unstable, that\nvery large nuclei will then break into pieces. Many pieces, a whole spectrum\nof pieces. But if you add up all of those pieces, they also have\nslightly less mass than the initial one did, the initial\nuranium or plutonium. And in that process, again, E=MC², a\ntremendous amount of energy is released. There's a very\nfamous curve in atomic physics, fusion or fission, looking\nat the periodic table. Going from the lightest elements, hydrogen, to the heaviest\nelements, those uranium, plutonium, and others. And fusion happens\nup to iron. Iron is the magical point in between\nwhere lighter elements than iron fuse together, and\nheavier elements fission or are fissile and break\napart and release energy. I think about and I\nlook at that process in stars, in that our star is\nfundamentally an early stage star that's burning just hydrogens.\nBut when it burns and does fusion, those hydrogens\ncombine into heliums, and later stage stars can then burn those\nheliums and they can fuse those together to form even heavier elements\nand carbons. And those carbons can fuse together and form heavier\nelements. And that whole stellar process is something\nthat inspires us at Helion to think about what are\nfusion fuels, not just the simplest ones, but more advanced fusion\nfuels that we see in stars throughout the - Okay, so there's a million things I want to\nsay. First, zooming out to the biggest possible picture, if you look across\nhundreds of millions, billions of years, and all the, my opinion, alien civilizations that are out there,\nthey're going to be powered likely by fusion. So our advanced intelligent\ncivilization is powered by fusion in that the sun is our power plant. Then the other thing is the physics. Again,\nvery basic, but you said E equals MC squared a couple times. Can you\nexplain this equation? - E=MC squared is a fundamental relationship that a\npatent clerk, Einstein, discovered and unlocked an entire new realm of physics\nand engineering and has shown us engineering and has shown us atomic physics, what happens inside the nucleus,\nand unlocked our understanding of the universe and paved the way for many of the\nphysics advancements that came after. That we think about mass as these particles. But\nin reality, at the same time, they're energy, and there's a direct quantitative relationship\nbetween how much energy is in all of that mass. And in fact, all of the energy that is released,\neven by atomic physics, certainly in atomic reactions, is E=MC squared. I think most\npeople have heard of and are used to this. But also in chemistry and in chemical bonds,\nthere is a change in mass. When you take a those chemical bonds, there is a\nchange in mass. When you take a hydrogen and an oxygen and you burn them and you\ncombine them into water, there's a change in mass. Now, that change per atom and per molecule is\nactually so small that it's extremely hard to molecule is actually so small\nthat it's extremely hard to measure, but it's still there. That's the energy\nthat is released, and you can quantify that. We use units of electron volts as a unit of what\nis the energy in atomic processes or chemical processes. - Can you also just speak to the different fuels\nthat you mentioned, both on the fusion and fission side? ...fission side? So uranium, plutonium for the\nfission, and then hydrogen isotopes for the fusion? - So for fission, uranium and plutonium, we don't\nmake those nuclei. Those, right now for humanity, make those nuclei. Those,\nright now, for humanity, those have been made in the primordial\nuniverse through super-supernova and Big Bang and the initial formation of the universe where\nmatter was created. And so we dig those up. We dig up uranium, plutonium out of the ground.\nAnd in fact, most plutonium we make from uranium, and we can talk about how to enrich\nuranium if we want to go down that road. But that's how we get those molecules and nuclei.\nFor fusion materials, hydrogenic species, or hydrogens are primordial in the universe.\nAlso, only the most common things that are in primordial in the universe. Also\nonly the most common things the universe. The suns and stars are made up\nof hydrogens and heliums, and so the vast majority of atoms in the\nuniverse still are hydrogen. - So the basic fuel for fission is already\nin the ground, and then the basic fuel for fusion is everywhere. - Is everywhere, and we particularly\nuse a type of hydrogen called deuterium, which\nis a heavier isotope of hydrogen. Hydrogen is\ntypically one proton and one electron, atomic mass of one.\nDeuterium is an atomic mass of two, which is a proton, which is a\ncharged particle, and it has a neutron in its nucleus, which is an uncharged\nparticle. And so that's deuterium. As the fuel now, deuterium is also\nfound in all water on Earth, in the water I'm drinking right now. It's in my\nbody. It's in Coca-Cola. It's everywhere. And it's safe and clean and one of\nthose fundamental particles that was born in the cosmos, and\nwe estimate that in seawater here on Earth, we have,\nif we powered at our current use of electricity, all\nof humanity on fusion, somewhere between 100 million\nyears and a billion years of fuel in hydrogen and\ndeuterium here on Earth. - And how is that stored mostly? - Mostly that's just in water.\nMostly it's a mix of, we call this actually heavy water, where\nyou have normal water that you're used to. We talk about and you\nlearn in school, is H2O, where there's two hydrogens and\noxygen in a nucleus in the molecule. And deuterium,\nor heavy water, is D2O, two deuteriums and\nan oxygen. In reality, it's actually an interesting\nmix where you have some HDO, so a mix of hydrogen and\ndeuterium. You also have other hydrogen but also in chemistry and in chemical bonds, that\nin those chemical bonds, there is a change in mass. - ...fission side? So uranium, plutonium for the fission, and then hydrogen\nisotopes for the fusion? In terms of fuel, is that correct to say? - That's correct to say at today's power\nlevel. I think what's interesting is the idea that as we deploy the\nsame power source that powers the universe here on Earth\nas humans, can we do more? Can we have access to much\nmore electricity, and much more energy and do really interesting\nthings with that? And still there's large amounts, millions and\nmillions of years of power even at much higher output power\nlevels for humanity. - Yeah, so the moment we\nstart running out of hydrogen and helium, that means\nwe're doing some pretty incredible things with our technology.\nAnd then that technology is probably going to allow us to propagate out into\nthe universe and then discover other sources. Because you can also get\nit on other planets. Whatever planets have water, it looks\nmore and more likely like a lot of them do. What an incredible future, just\nout into the cosmos, nuclear power plants everywhere. Okay, so to linger on\nsome of the technical stuff, you said strong nuclear force. So\nhow exactly is the energy created? So how does the E=MC\nsquared, the M go to the E infusion? - So in fusion, you take these\nlightweight isotopes like hydrogen and deuterium, and as\nyou combine them and get them closer and closer together, some really\ninteresting fundamental physics happens. So first these atomic nuclei are\ncharged. They have an electric these atomic nuclei are\ncharged. They have an electric charge, and they like charges\nrepel. And I think everybody is familiar with that, where you take two\npositive charges, and you try to push them together, and the electromagnetic\nforce between them repels them. So you have a force that's actually\npushing against them. So in fusion, you work to get your fuel very hot,\nvery, very high temperatures, 100 million degree temperatures. And\ntemperature really is kinetic energy. It's motion, it's velocity. So that\nthese particles are moving so fast that even though they're coming\ntogether and there's this repulsive electromagnetic force, they can still come\nclose enough that another force comes into play, which is the strong\nforce. And then once you get within a very close distance\non the order of the scale of those nuclei themselves, of those atomic\nnuclei. So the tiniest thing you could imagine, and probably way smaller\nthan that, these particles then are attracted to each other and\nthey combine and they fuse together. At that point, you create\nheavier atomic nuclei that have a slightly less mass, slightly\nless total mass in the system, and that mass equals MC squared as energy. - So extremely high\ntemperature, extremely high speed. Maybe that's one of the\nother differences also with fusion and fission, is just the amount\nof temperature required for the reactions. Is that accurate to say? - Yeah, and I think fundamentally\nit's that in a lot of ways, fusion is hard and fission is easy. Nuclear fission happens at room\ntemperature, that this uranium and plutonium is so likely\nto break apart already that simply the adding of one of\nthese neutrons, one extra particle will then break it\napart and release energy. And if you have a lot of them\ntogether, it will create a chain reaction. Fusion, that doesn't\nhappen at all. Fusion is actually really hard to do. You have to overcome\nthose electromagnetic forces to have a single fusion reaction happen. And\nso it takes things like in our sun we have what is called gravitational\nconfinement, where the gravity, literally the\nmass of the fuel itself is pulling to the center of the sun\nand it's pulling. And so there's a large force that's pulling all\nthat fuel together and holding it and confining it together such\nthat it gets close enough and hot enough for long enough\nthat fusion happens. - And then we have to figure out if we're\nbuilding fusion reactors, we have to figure out how to do that confinement\nwithout the huge size gravity of the sun. - That's right. Obviously, the sun\nis vastly larger than Earth, and so we can't do that same\nprocess here on Earth. - Yet. No, I'm just kidding. All right. - But we have other forces we get to use.\nWe can use the electromagnetic force, which the sun doesn't get to\ndo, to apply those forces. And I actually want to take a pause\nright there and point out a word. Historically, we've used the word reactor\naround fusion, but I don't think that's right. And for me, we're really\ncareful about this terminology. When we look to how that word\nis defined, and we can look to how the experts define it, it\ndoesn't really apply to fusion. So the Nuclear Regulatory\nCommission, the NRC, defines reactor as, I have it\nright here, \"A nuclear reactor is an apparatus\nother than an atomic weapon, designed or used to sustain\nnuclear fission in a self-supporting chain reaction.\"\nAnd there's two big parts to that. That one, fission\nreaction. Obviously, fusion is not that, and we've talked\nabout why, but also the self-sustaining part. In that a reactor is\nself-sustaining, you take your hands off of it and it keeps\ngoing. In fusion, that doesn't happen. And we know because we have\nto do it every day and it's really hard to do. And so we actually\nuse the word generator, because we don't talk about, for instance, a\nnatural gas reactor, is that if you stop putting in fuel, it turns\noff. And the same thing happens in fusion. And so we're pretty\ncareful about making sure we talk about that as a generator where\nyou're putting in fuel, you're getting electricity out. And then when\nyou stop putting in fuel, it just shuts off. And you can go even one step\nfurther and say, \"What am I going to do with this fusion that powers the universe? And\nwhat does humanity want out of this?\" And what we want is electricity.\nWe don't simply want a set of reactions or even heat and\nenergy. That's great, but what I really want is electricity. - And yeah, we'll talk about the technical\ndetails of one of the big benefits of the linear design of the approach\nthat you do is you get to electricity directly as quickly as possible.\nAnd some of the other alternatives, have an intermediate step, and\nthose again, are technical details, but let me still linger on\nthe difference between... fusion and fission. What are some\nadvantages at a high level of nuclear fusion as a source of energy? - fundamentally as a source of energy.\nIn fusion, you're taking these lightweight isotopes, you're bringing\nthem together, you're releasing energy, and that energy is in the\nform of charged particles. It's already in the form of\nelectricity. Fusion itself has electricity built into it\nwithout a lot of the steam or thermal system requirements. And so,\nthat's a really nice fundamental benefit of fusion itself.\nAlso, this reaction that's really hard to do turns\nitself off, so you end up with that fusion is fundamentally safe, and\nthat's really a key requirement of any industrial system is that it\nturns itself off and is safe. You turn the key off on your car,\nyou know it's going to turn off. - I guess the flip side of that, just stating\nthe obvious, but it's nice to lay it out. nice to lay it out. For nuclear fission, it's\na chain reaction, so it's hard to shut off, reaction, so it's hard to shut off, and\nit works by boiling water into steam, by boiling water into steam, which spins\nturbines and produces electricity. and produces electricity. Can you talk through\nthis process in a nuclear fission reactor? process in a nuclear fission reactor? - In a nuclear fission reactor,\nyou put enough of this fissile material, uranium or\nplutonium, together such that as these unstable molecules,\nthese unstable atoms crack open and break apart,\nthey release heat, that the component parts of those are\nactually quite hot. And so not only are the component parts that the uranium breaks into,\nand it's a whole spectrum of different atoms and atomic nuclei, and it's a whole spectrum of different atoms and\natomic nuclei, are hot, but it also releases neutrons. are hot, but it also releases neutrons. It also\nreleases more of these uncharged particles. more of these uncharged particles. And if you do it right,\nthis fissile material will be next to other fissile material, this fissile material will be next to other fissile material,\nand so that neutron will then go and bombard another and so that neutron will then go and bombard another\nuranium nucleus, again opening that up and releasing uranium nucleus, again opening that up and\nreleasing more heat and more of these neutrons. more heat and more of these neutrons. And that's how you\nhave those reactions of a self-supporting chain reaction, those reactions of a self-supporting chain\nreaction, and that chain reaction then continues. and that chain reaction then continues. People design\nfission reactors such that you have just the right balance fission reactors such that you have just the right balance of\nenough neutrons are made such that the reaction is continuing, of enough neutrons are made such that the reaction is\ncontinuing, but not so many neutrons are made that it speeds up. because you don't want it to speed up. - And there's some kind of cooling mechanisms also? Like,\nthat's part of the art and the engineering of it? and the engineering of it? - And then the key is at the same time, you want to make sure that\nthe whole thing is in water, is typically the cooling fluid. whole thing is in water, is typically the cooling fluid. There's some\nmore advanced fission reactors that have different cooling fluids, advanced fission reactors that have different cooling fluids,\nbut water typically, where then that absorbs that both the heat but water typically, where then that absorbs that both the heat and\nthose extra neutrons. And so you use the water and the fluid to then extra neutrons. And so you use the water and the fluid to then\nrun a steam turbine to do traditional electricity generation run a steam turbine to do traditional electricity generation\nand output electricity through your steam turbine. and output electricity through your steam turbine. You end up\nwith complicated systems of flowing liquids and flowing water, up with complicated systems of flowing liquids\nand flowing water, balancing the heat. balancing the heat. A lot of fission reactor design\ncomes from that thermal balance of keeping this reaction comes from that thermal balance of keeping this reaction\ngoing, making sure it doesn't speed up, because that's going, making sure it doesn't speed up, because that's an\nuncontrolled chain reaction, which you would not want, an uncontrolled chain reaction, which you would not want, and\nbalancing the cooling and the output of getting the water out of it. want, and balancing the cooling and the\noutput of getting the water out of it. - So we should say that for reasons you already\nlaid out, maybe you can speak to it a bit more, maybe you can speak to it a bit more, is nuclear\nfusion is much safer. So there's no chain is much safer. So there's no chain reaction\ngoing on. You can just shut it off. You can just shut it off. But it should also be said that as\nfar as I understand, the current fission nuclear reactors as far as I understand, the current fission\nnuclear reactors are also very safe. are also very safe. I think there's a perception that\nnuclear fission reactors are unsafe, they're dangerous. fission reactors are unsafe, they're dangerous. And\nif you just look empirically at the statistics, look empirically at the statistics, that the\nfear is not justified by the actual safety data. by the actual safety data. Can you\njust speak to that a little bit? - Yeah. We've been talking about the reaction\nprocesses themselves, but I think fundamentally, fundamentally, let's take a step back and look a little\nbroader and say, \"Let's look at what we care about,\" look at what we care about, which is the power plant, making\nelectricity. And I look at this from a nuclear engineer's point of view. this from a nuclear engineer's point of view.\nI spent a lot of years studying these systems. studying these systems. And modern fission\nreactors, I believe, are engineered to be safe. believe, are engineered to be safe. They're engineered\nin ways where as those reactions maybe speed up where as those reactions maybe speed\nup and those systems get hotter, and those systems get hotter, they actually are built\nto expand and cool down passively and natively. cool down passively and natively. And there's protection\nsystems in place that modern systems are quite safe place that modern systems are quite\nsafe from an engineering perspective. perspective. And so I believe that we have figured\nout how to build nuclear fission reactors in a way build nuclear fission reactors in a way where\nthe engineering of the power plant is safe. plant is safe. I would say that I look back\nat the history of what we've built over time, of what we've built over time, and the challenge\nhasn't come to the engineering actually. engineering actually. I believe the engineers have\nsolved these problems. The problem comes from humans, The problem comes from humans, and the problem\ncomes from other things around nuclear power. comes from other things around nuclear power. You\nhave to enrich that uranium to put it in a plant. enrich that uranium to put it in a plant. And the\nplant's safe, but you had to enrich that uranium, but you had to enrich that uranium, and that is\nsome of the problem. Or a plant is designed to run Or a plant is designed to run for a certain number of\ndecades safely, but do we run it longer than that? but do we run it longer than that? And so those\nare where I think the real challenges happen, the real challenges happen, is more with the humans around these\nsystems than the engineering of the power plants themselves. than the engineering of the\npower plants themselves. - Well, I have to ask then, what do you think happened\nin Chernobyl? What lessons do we learn from Chernobyl What lessons do we learn from Chernobyl nuclear disaster\nand maybe also Three Mile Island and Fukushima accidents? Fukushima accidents? I think you're suggesting\nthat it has to do with the humans a bit. humans a bit. - So with Chernobyl and Fukushima, I actually\nput Three Mile Island in a different category. in a different category. In fact, some of the recent news in the\nlast year is that we're gonna be restarting Three Mile Island, year is that we're gonna be restarting Three Mile Island,\nbecause there's such a need for clean base load power. such a need for clean base load power. So that's actually\na very interesting other topic we should talk about, interesting other topic we should talk about, is\nwhy and how we're doing that. But more than that, But more than that, going back to the accidents that\ndid happen in both of those systems, you can point to in both of those systems, you can point to the human failure\nrather than the engineering failures of those systems. the human failure rather than the engineering failures\nof those systems. That in Fukushima specifically, That in Fukushima specifically, there were multiple nuclear\nfission reactors on the same site that successfully reactors on the same site that successfully kept\nrunning through the tsunami, totally successfully, the tsunami, totally successfully, and were only\nlater shut down for more political reasons. more political reasons. But the old one, the oldest\nof them that had been on site for long periods, them that had been on site for long periods, and maybe, maybe\ntoo long, I think some experts have looked at this in the past I think some experts have looked at this in the past\nwas where some of the problems actually happened. was where some of the\nproblems actually happened. And so, I look to that less as a failure\nof the engineering of the power plants, engineering of the power plants, and\nmore of the humans around those systems. around those systems. That we should be operating these\nplants as designed, and then I believe they're safe. these plants as designed, and then I believe they're safe.\nAnd that gets to some of the atomic weapons questions And that gets to some of the atomic weapons questions\nthat I think are the other part around nuclear reactors are the other part around nuclear reactors and\nfission reactors that are concerning for me. - Can you speak to those? So, maybe this is a good place\nto also lay out the difference between nuclear fission lay out the difference between nuclear fission\npower plants and nuclear fission weapons, power plants and nuclear\nfission weapons, and maybe also nuclear fusion power plants\nand nuclear fusion weapons. Like, what are the differences here? - Fusion power plants can't be used to\nmake nuclear weapons. Fundamentally, the processes in fusion aren't the\nsame processes that happen in nuclear bombs and nuclear\nweapons. It's actually one reason I started in fusion, and most of our team thinks about the mission of fusion, of\ndelivering clean, safe electricity, is it also can't be used to\nmake weapons. And I think that's a little bit of a distinction\nfrom traditional nuclear fission reactors, is that\nwhile I totally believe as a nuclear engineer, we can build power\nplants now that are safe, that aren't going to have reactions.\nThey use a fuel, uranium and plutonium, that can\nbe used to make nuclear weapons. We know that if you\ntake enough fissile material together, enough uranium and\nplutonium, put it in a small volume, that it will not just create a reaction,\nbut it will create a supercritical reaction that will then continue and grow and\nrelease a tremendous amount of energy all at once. And that is a bomb. That is\na bad situation, and that is what we want to avoid. A lot of the key is\nrecognizing that even though there are things called fusion bombs,\nthe H-bomb, the hydrogen bomb, the hydrogen bomb has\nuranium in it. It's still a fission bomb. So, fundamentally,\nthis works because you have a fission reaction, a primary, and\nthat creates radiation that induces a fusion reaction with a small\namount of fusion fuel that then boosts that uranium\nreaction again. And so most of the energy, in fact 90%\nof the energy in an H-bomb, is all still from the uranium\nreactions themselves. - Yeah, I think people call it a\nnuclear fusion bomb, a hydrogen bomb, but really it's still a\nnuclear fission bomb. It's just that fusion is a part of the process to make it\nmore powerful, but you still need, like you said, the uranium fuel. So it's\nnot accurate to think of it as a fusion bomb really. - And if you take away that\nfissile material, that nuclear fission reaction, the fusion\nreaction doesn't happen at all. In fact, researchers have over the decades tried to make\nan all fusion bomb and been very unsuccessful at it. The physics and the\nengineering don't support it can ever happen with our understanding today.\nThe topic we're talking about is more broadly called proliferation,\nand this is the creation of nuclear weapons in the\nworld and the distribution of those weapons. And something\nwe know as physicists and engineers is that fusion\ncan't be used to make nuclear weapons. We know\nthat. But that is not sort of widely known. And part\nof what we went out to do is work with the proliferation\nexperts in the world, the people who work to prevent nuclear weapons from\nbeing made, being created, being shared throughout the world, because we know the\nchallenges, the geopolitical challenges that happen. And we went to those\nproliferation experts, and we were worried they would have\nthe sort of the same historical question of, like, \"Well, the\nword nuclear is in fusion, so therefore it must be related.\" And,\nand in fact, the total opposite happened. What they\ntold us is, \"Please, please go develop fusion power plants\nabsolutely as fast as possible. The world needs this.\" And the\nproliferation experts were telling us that otherwise people would\nstart enriching uranium throughout the world, and we'd be building enriched\nuranium power plants because we need the electricity that's clean\nand base load. But in those processes, they'll be making fuel\nthat could be one day used for atomic weapons, for nuclear weapons,\nand they were worried that, that the growth of this enriched\nuranium, think about the centrifuges, that having a lot more\ncentrifuges happening all over the world would lead to more weapons,\nat least the possibility of it. And so they are pushing us\nas fast as possible, go build fusion generators and get them deployed\neverywhere. Not just in the United States, but all over the world so that\nwe're building fusion power and that's meeting humanity's\nneeds, not this other thing. And so I was really pleasantly surprised. We've\nwritten a number of papers and worked with those communities on this of\nwhat does it mean, how is fusion power safe and can't\nbe used for nuclear weapons. - So, this might be interesting to\nask on the geopolitics side of things. I have the chance to\ninterview a few world leaders coming up. By way of advice, what\nquestions should I ask world leaders to figure out the geopolitics\nof nuclear, nuclear proliferation. ...nuclear weapons, nuclear fission power plants, and nuclear fusion power plants?\nWhat's the interesting, intricate complexity there that you\ncould maybe speak to? - The question I would want to ask is, \"What\nwould you do if we could deliver for you low-cost, clean, industrial scale, tens\nor hundreds of megawatts of fusion power that's low-cost, clean,\nbaseload and doesn't have the geopolitical\nconsequences of uranium and plutonium, of fissile\nmaterial, what would you do there? How would that change\nyour view of the next 30 years? - But also, there's a lot of geopolitics\nconnected to oil, natural gas- ...and other sources of energy which I\nthink are important in Saudi Arabia, in the Middle East, in Russia. I mean, all across the world. And that's interesting\ntoo. So do you think actually if everybody has nuclear fusion power plants, that alleviates some of the geopolitical\ntension that have to do with energy, other energy sources? - I certainly do, that the fuel\nis in seawater all over Earth. Everybody has deuterium.\nAnd everybody has it. And so you can't have a\nmonopoly on the fuel. And no one can control the fuel and no one\ncan turn off the fuel, no one can cut a pipeline. That just cannot\nhappen with fusion. And so if we can deploy those plants\nand we can deploy them quickly, then it decouples the ability of any one\nor any few countries to control energy. - Okay, so let's sort of return to the\nbasic question, we already mentioned it a little bit, but is nuclear fusion safe? So the power plants that we're talking\nabout, fusion power plants, are they safe? - Yes. Fusion power is\nfundamentally safe. The physics and the reactions\nof the fusion system itself means you don't have runaways. And so\nwe've talked about some of the human factors around power plants and\npower systems and industrial scale systems. And that's something that\nwe build into the design of these from today. We look at, \"How these systems might fail?\" And in\nfact, some of the analysis we do is we did this analysis\nfor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over the last few years,\nlooking at how do you regulate fusion power. As we're building the first\nfusion power plant, we need to make sure we're regulated safely. And so we\nspent a lot of time doing the technical case and the political\ncase in the United States, of how to regulate fusion. And so the analysis we did is assume you have a fusion\npower plant that's operating. And then at any one time, a meteor\nstrikes it. The whole thing is vaporized. What is the impact of\nthat? So this is worse than you could ever imagine an actual physical\nscenario, but let's start there. And the answer is, you\ndon't need to evacuate the populace nearby the\nfusion power plant. And one of the keys, I think, that\nI come to when I think about this is the fuel. In that, in a fusion\ngenerator, you are continuously feeding in this hydrogen, these\ndeuterium fuels. And at any one time in a Helion\nfusion system, and most fusion systems, you have one\nsecond of fuel in that system. And so what that means\nis if you stop putting fuel into that system, fusion just stops.\nBut what it also means is that if something really catastrophic\nhappened and, for whatever reason, you have all that fuel\nthat's not in the system. And fusion is so hard to make happen.\nYou hit it with a meteor, you do anything of that nature, and\nfusion doesn't happen. That hydrogen, that heavy water, that\ndeuterium, just goes back into the environment safely and cleanly\nwithout issue. And so that's the fundamental safety mechanism of\nfusion, and you can compare that with other types of power\nplants, oil or a coal power plant. You might have a large pile of coal\nthat then catches fire and burns. And it's not catastrophic, but you have a\nlarge coal fire for a long time releasing toxic fumes that you may have\nto deal with. And in nuclear power, in a fission power plant, you may\nhave several years of fuel sitting in the core. And in that case, if something bad\nhappened, you have all that potential energy for things to happen. But in fusion, you have literally one\nsecond of fuel at any time in the system. And having a tank of deuterium,\nwhich we have around all the time, can't do fusion by itself. It\nneeds that complex system. - I love that there's, like, a PowerPoint\ngoing on in a secret meeting about what happens if a meteor\nhits a fusion power plant. Okay, so that's really interesting. What\nabout the waste? What kind of waste is there for fusion power plants? - So the fusion reaction itself is\nstill fundamentally an atomic reaction. And so during this\nreaction, you do create ionizing radiation. You create X-rays, you create\nneutrons, and you create all these charged particles. The charged particles\nthemselves for a fusion reaction are all contained in the- the fusion system. And the X-rays, similar to think\nabout a dentist office, although a lot more than that,\nbut that type of same X-ray and X-ray energy is absorbed by the fusion system.\nBut the thing we do care about is those neutrons. And so we do have, in\na fusion system, activation. We have, during its operation, neutrons\nare made and leave, and so we have to shield these fusion systems\nduring their operation. and so this is very similar, in fact,\nthis is a lot of the work we did with the Nuclear Regulatory Commission over\nthe last number of years. That there was a landmark agreement that\nhappened for the NRC that then was codified into law last year\ncalled the ADVANCE Act, which is really powerful because it says\nfor the very first time-... how the US government, leading the way on\nthis, which I'm really proud of, will regulate fusion. And this\ngets into a little bit of the details, but the way the\nNuclear Regulatory Commission regulates nuclear things\nin the United States is in these different sets\nof statutes. And nuclear is in these different sets of statutes. And nuclear reactors\nare regulated under something called Part 50. And there's a lot of variety of the regulatory\nlanguage around that, but most of it is to handle special nuclear materials,\nuranium and plutonium. But fusion is not. Fusion is regulated\nunder something called Part 30. And Part 30 is how hospitals\nare regulated, particle accelerators, other types\nof irradiators where as they're operating, you have very high energy\nparticles, ionizing radiation, and you have to protect operators from it. And\nyou have to shield them, and so we build concrete shields. And if you came\nand visited Helion, you would see plastic, Plastic, borated polyethylene\nand concrete shielding, To protect operators and equipment from\nthe fusion reactions while they're happening. But again, you turn them\noff, and those fusion reactions stop. And that's really the key. There's\na funny story related to that. We, We've been building fusion\nsystems that do fusion a long time, and a- at\nsome level, we- they got powerful enough doing enough fusion, we\nstarted building these shields and- and shielding them like a particle\naccelerator. And I went to the regulatory bodies\nthat regulate Part 30. This is in Washington state. It's the\nDepartment of Health. And so I went to the Department of Health and said, \"Here's\nan application for a fusion generator shielding permit as- as\na particle accelerator.\" And uh, the very first question I\ngot asked was, \"Great, where do the patients go?\" Because the\nstandard form had a patient, As a hospital, the patient dose for\nthe particle accelerator, and then the shielding. And we talked all about the shielding and the\noperators, which is very similar for a Helion system. We said, \"No, no patients at all. No\none's inside this thing. Our goal is to generate electricity one day.\"\nThis was a lot of years ago. And we were able to go through and\nwork with the state agencies to license these fusion particle\naccelerators. We were, as far as we know, the first licensed fusion system ever as\na particle accelerator for those first systems. The first license\nwe had was in 2020. We then have gone on and now license\nseveral of our fusion systems that we've built that do fusion, both the shielding\nas well as some of the fuel processes. - So high level, what are the\ndifferent ways to build a nuclear fusion power plant? Can you explain\nwhat a tokamak is, what a stellarator is, and what's the linear\napproach that Helion is using? - So there are a number of ways to do\nfusion. And fundamentally, in all fusion approaches, you're trying to do\nthe same fundamental physical process, which is take these\nlightweight isotopes, heat them up, so that they can move at high\nvelocity, over 100 million degrees, bring enough of\nthem together. We call it density. Enough of them together\nin a certain volume, so that you have reactions happening at\na higher rate, and keep them together long enough that they are\nable to collide into each other and do fusion and release energy. That's\nthe fundamental core. Now, how you do that, how you bring those\nparticles together, how you hold them together long enough, there's a wide\nrange of technologies that, as humans, we've been exploring since the 1950s. And I think about several\nmain categories. If you look at the fusion funding out there, government\nfunding in the world, private funding actually has quite a different\nprofile, which is an interesting thing to talk about. But in public funding, in\nfederal funding in the United States, there's two mainline programs\ncalled inertial fusion and magnetic fusion. And in\ninertial fusion, what you're trying to do is bring\ntogether and push together by a variety of means, physical means,\nthose particles. You push them together. The most common is\ncalled laser inertial fusion. Our colleagues at the National Ignition\nFacility did this really well and made world records in the last few years\nfor being able to demonstrate you can do this and do it at scale. Where\nyou take very high power lasers and pulse them together\nto combine them to do fusion for a pulse, for a\nvery short period of time. Nanoseconds, billionths\nof a second. The other extreme, and you mentioned\ntokamaks and stellarators. Stellarators are actually my\nfavorite. So we'll talk about those. As a graduate student in fusion, the\nstellarator is the first thing you learn about. Because there's a mathematical solution\nfor a stellarator that solves perfectly. And you can write it out\nand you can solve it, and analytically, it's very\nsimple. Building one is very hard. And so it's taken humanity a number of decades to be able to build\nstellarators and we can do it now with the Wendelstein 7-X\nthat came online in the last few years, being the premier\nstellarator in the world. - I should say, all the\ndifferent ways to do fusion all just look so badass\nin terms of engineering. Creating this containment,\nextremely high temperature, high density. Everything's\nmoving super fast. Everything is happening super fast. It's just\nfascinating that humans are able to do it. Like, there are certain things, accelerators\nof that a little bit, but this is even cooler, because you're generating\nenergy that can power humanity with this machine. Anyway, can you\njust speak a little bit more to the inertial and the magnetic fusion systems? - In a magnetic system, your goal is not to push together those particles\nas fast as possible. Your goal is to hold on to them for as\nlong as possible. And to do that, we use magnetic fields. So let's take a\nstep back. What is a magnetic field? So in an electromagnet, there are a variety of ways to make a magnetic field. One of\nthe most famous, I think everyone is familiar with, is Earth itself.\nEarth has what we call the magnetosphere, which is the\nmagnetic protection that's generated actually by the core\nof the Earth. But we have a magnetic field around the\nEarth, and that magnetic field protects us from\nparticles coming from the galaxy, galactic cosmic\nrays and solar particles that would come to Earth. That magnetic field\nwhen you run a compass, you see the magnetic field from the Earth. So we know\nit's happening. It's all over. But how we generate it with electric currents\nis a little bit different. And what we do is that we have a loop of\nwire, and the simplest way to think about it is literally a round\nloop. And in that loop, you have electrons. You have electrical current that's\nrunning. And when electrical current, this is some of Maxwell's equations that\nwe discovered in the 1800s, that when you have an electrical current in\na wire, it generates a magnetic field inside that wire.\nAnd so when you look at fusion systems, you\nalways have these big magnetic coils with large amounts of current.\nWe don't run a little bit of current. In our systems, we have hundreds of\nmega amps of current. If you think about at your house, you have your breaker box with 200 amps\nor maybe a 400 amp breaker box, and we run 100 million\namps of electrical current. So massive amounts of electrical current\nto be able to do this. So that magnetic field that's\ngenerated inside that magnetic coil has some really special\nproperties, and we take advantage of those properties to do fusion. And\nsome of those properties are not intuitive. So here's one of my\nfavorites. When you have an electromagnetic field, you have this\ncoil with electricity going around it and you have a magnetic field\ninside of it, and then you have a test particle, a\ncharged particle, an electron or an ion, which is, if you\nimagine to generate this, I have a coil with electrons moving around\nit. But if I put one in the middle of it, in this magnetic field, some\nreally interesting things happen. That electron or that ion, that\ncharged particle is what's called magnetized. And what\nmagnetized means is that it's trapped on that field line. In\nfact, even really more interesting is that it oscillates around that\nfield line. And so the way I think about this is if you think about the\nEarth's magnetosphere again, and you think about the charged particles, the\naurora, the northern lights, is a charged particle trapped in the\nEarth's magnetic field going around the Earth's magnetic field. And in the same way,\nin fusion, we do the same thing here on Earth, but in a smaller direction where we\ntrap these particles on magnetic fields, and they can go around and stay\ntrapped to that magnetic field line. - How much of the physics at this scale is understood here?\nLike, how these systems behave when you attract a magnetic field in this\nway? Like, is this fundamentally now an engineering problem, or is there a new\nphysics to be discovered about how the system is behaving? - In fusion, the physics we're\nusing is actually quite old. The fundamental\nelectromagnetic physics is 1800s physics. The fundamental atomic\nphysics is early 1900s. And so the fundamental physics\nof how these work is very well understood. Putting them all\ntogether into a power plant, that's hard. You can do the\nmath. Every introductory grad student does the math on a stellarator\nand says, \"This is all I need to do. I just need to make a\nmagnetic coil in this very complicated shape. And then\nfusion will happen.\" However, doing that in practice is\nactually quite challenging. - So maybe you could speak a little\nbit more. So the stellarator and the tokamak, what's the difference between\nthose two? They're both magnetic fusion systems? And then what does Helion do? - The tokamak and the stellarator\nare both magnetic systems. Their goal is to generate\nthis magnetic field and hold onto the fusion fuel long\nenough. Like I mentioned, these charged particles are trapped on the\nmagnetic field. In fact, they're oscillating. We call that a gyro orbit, is\nthe radius that they oscillate around this magnetic field. And we've\nbeen talking about atomic physics, where everything is at this\nnanoscale. But gyro orbits are not. Gyro orbits for these fusion\nparticles are measured in inches. And so they're in, on a\nscale that we can see and measure and understand\nreally intuitively. And in a magnetic system, your goal is to simply\ntrap as many of these particles as you can for long enough, and\nheat them so they're hot enough so that they bang into each other.\nThey collide enough that you're doing fusion. And you're doing enough fusion\nto overcome as fast as you're losing those particles. And so that's what\nhappens when you put particles in a magnetic field and you try to hold\nonto it. The challenge is that it's really hard to hold onto them long\nenough. These particles are moving around. They're moving at very high velocity,\nmillions of miles per hour. They're colliding with each other and they're\ngetting knocked off and getting knocked away. So we've talked about\ninertial fusion, where you try to confine a fusion plasma by crushing it as fast as possible. And magnetic\nfusion, where you just simply have a magnetic field and your goal\nis to hold onto it for as long as possible. But there's another\nway to do fusion, and in some ways, it's one of the earliest approaches for fusion that was\nsuccessful. As scientists and engineers, maybe we're not too creative\nwith the terminology. We call the technique We call the technique that Helion uses magneto\ninertial fusion, because it does a little bit of both. So to understand that, we can actually go back\nin history a little bit and think about the evolution of some of these approaches to\nfusion. And so from our perspective, we look at the technology\nthat we use as built on physics experiments that were\nvery successful in the 1950s. And in those systems,\nthe earliest pioneers of fusion said, \"I know, we\nunderstand the physics. We have to take these gases, heat\nthem to 100 million degrees, and then confine them, push them together so\nthat fusion happens.\" And so, what is the best way to do that? So some\nof the earliest programs we call them theta pinch. And what those\nprograms were, were a linear topology, because we knew how to\nbuild these magnets. It's called a solenoid, where you take a series of\nelectric coils, you run electrical current through them, that generates a\nmagnetic field. Great, so you have a magnetic field. Now you add your fusion\nparticles. Okay? So you've added fusion particles to this solenoid.\nHere's the challenge. Those particles, as they're sitting in that\nmagnetic field in this nice magnet, escape. They leave out the ends, 'cause\nthere's nothing holding them in. Great. So that makes sense.\nAnd so that doesn't work, okay? So then the next approach\nis to say, \"Well, one branch of fusion said, 'Okay, well, to solve that,\nwhy don't we take the solenoid and bend it around? Let's just make it a big donut. So\nas they're escaping, they go around and around in a circle.' Great. That's a\ngreat approach. And so one branch of fusion went down that direction. And that became, that evolved\ninto the stellarator and the tokamak. Different ways of taking\nthose solenoids and wrapping them around so that the plasmas go 'round and\n'round in that magnetic field and are held- those charged particles are held long\nenough that fusion happens. But there's a different way to do it. And so the\ntheta pinch was what was born in the 1950s of, \"Take this magnetic\nfield and, oh, they're trying to escape. Great. Let's not let\nthem escape. Let's close the bottle-\" Mm-hmm. \"...let's close the ends.\"\nAnd so we make the magnetic field much stronger at the ends. This one was called\nthe mirror. And so the idea was that the particles would bounce\nin between. And that worked, and they got hotter and hotter and hotter.\nBut guess what? As you kind of would imagine, as this mirror topology,\nthis linear topology, the pressure increased inside,\nthe particle pressure, the particles tried to push back on the magnetic\nfield. They were trying to escape now. They're trying, they're getting hotter and\nhotter. And just as you imagine, hot gas in a balloon tries to get out the ends,\nyou could not hold it tight enough at the ends to keep those particles in. And\nin fact, the problem is the hottest ones were the ones that would escape. Mm-hmm. And so you do\na good job of heating it, and they'd all leave out the ends. Okay? So then the next iteration\nsaid, \"Okay, well, why don't we just not try to hold onto it very\nlong? Why don't we squeeze it?\" And so rather than just holding it\nconstantly, let's now crush it. So we built this solenoid,\nwe pinched the ends, and then we crushed it. And what\nI mean by crushing it is not actually, like, crushing any\nmagnets or changing the- the topology or moving any\nparts, but just rapidly increasing the magnetic field. And so\ngoing from a magnetic field that's just holding it to now taking all\nthose particles, if you imagine they if you imagine they were streaming around together, and then rapidly increasing the magnetic field\nso that those particles get closer and closer together. So you increase the density. And\nnow fusion starts to really happen. And now fusion starts to\nreally happen. But they ended up hitting a technological\nlimit. So this is the part that- that I look back and\nI'm, I look at the pioneers that, in 1958, there was\nsome pioneering work done. And this was in\nCalifornia, what later became Livermore Labs. There was also\nsome work done at other national labs too. These were all federally\nfunded programs to explore this theta pinch topology. Can you just squeeze\nthe plasma down fast enough, hard enough? plasma down fast enough,\nhard enough? This was 1958. The transistor was sitting in the laboratory, and they were\ncommuting, they were turning on millions of amps of electrical current. And they\nwere doing it, we haven't talked about the time scales, time scales, but they were\ndoing it in millionths of a second: microseconds, megahertz\nspeeds. And this was in 1958. No transistor, no CPUs, and no electrical\nswitches, none of the things that I take for and and no electrical switches,\nnone of the things that I take for granted every day. And so they\nwere able to show at that time the highest performing fusion systems. They\ngot to temperatures... They didn't get to 100 million degrees, not quite then, but\nthey got to 50 million degrees. They were outperforming everything else in fusion, but they\nreached the technical limit where they just could not build it anymore. And so they, the-\nthose pioneers, went in a different direction, and they started down the laser\ninertial path of saying like, \"Okay, well, we can't do these electromagnetic\npinches, but we now have inv- this new thing has invented\nthe laser,\" which turns on in nanoseconds. It's fast. It's interesting. Let's go\ndown that path. And it's not... You have to fast-forward a couple\nof decades to researchers found with some of these theta pinches\nwhen they're operated in a very specific way, something else happened,\nsomething new happened, and that these plasmas where\nbefore they squeezed them very hard, and just like squeezing a tube\nof toothpaste, they squirted out the ends. Now it didn't squirt out the ends.\nIt actually pushed back. It stayed confined. It stayed trapped inside\nthat linear topology. Even though the ends were open, the\nplasma didn't leave. And so there was a large amount of programs of, like,\n\"What is happening here?\" This is an accidental discovery in plasma physics that\nsomething new is happening. And what we discovered is we now call\nthe field reversed configuration. there's numerous programs\nof FRC, field reversed configuration programs both at\nnational labs. There's actually a number of private companies now\nof people building field reversed configurations. And they have some\nreally unique properties, but fundamentally, talking about the main difference,\nI describe the solenoid with magnetic fields throughout the center\nof that volume, and plasma trapped going back and forth. But some other\nthings can happen, which is really interesting. really interesting. And what\nthey discovered early is if they have field going in one\ndirection, so the plasma, the so the plasma, the electrical\ncurrent is going around the loop and the plasma is going back and\nforth along this magnetic field line inside that solenoid,\ninside that theta pinch. But then they change the\ndirection of the magnetic field. And this is what we call field\nreversal, and this is really the key is that you start with the plasma going\nin one direction, and then very rapidly, you change the direction. You change and\nreverse the direction of that field. And something really interesting\nhappens, which is the plasma, this fusion fuel, these charged\nparticles which are trapped on the magnetic field lines\nthat are moving back and forth, you change the direction. What that\nmeans is that you're trying to take that electrical current and that magnetic\nfield and reverse its direction, flip it, but it can't flip fast\nenough. The plasma is sitting there and you can't move the particles.\nAnd so what's really interesting is what happens is that because\nthe particles can't move, but you've now flipped the direction of\nthe magnetic field, you've inverted it. Something really, really unique\nhappens, which is that the plasma itself reconnects internally. And\nso now what you're left with is an outside magnetic field,\nan electrical coil, and inside, the plasma,\nwhere before it was moving along, it's now moving internally. - Rapidly reversing the magnetic field,\nplasma self-organizes into a closed field. What? So how... - It sounds wild. - It's, it's... Yeah. So, first of all,\nthere's a million questions I have. So one of them, what's rapidly? What\ntime scale are we talking about here? - Mm-hmm. You have to reverse\nthe electrical current faster than a millionth degree, which\nis a very hot gas particle, can move. - Okay. - And so that means we have to do it on\nthe order of a millionth of a second. - Wow. - We have to do it in a\nmillionth of a second. - Wow. - And, and so in practice... this is hard. And it's only, we can only do it now\nbecause of semiconductor switching. Because we can move things,\nwe can switch things. Like the transistor in every CPU in\na computer switches at a gigahertz, that means in a nanosecond, it's\nswitching in a billionth of a second. And so now, which we didn't in the 1950s\nwhen these theta pinches were invented, but now we have the semiconductors\nto be able to do that. - The self-organizing plasma. Can you just speak to that? What the\nheck is it doing? How do we discover, how do we understand the self-organizing\nmechanism, the dynamics of the plasma that's able to contain itself? - So what I like to do is use an\nanalogy here: once you've made it, it's actually somewhat straightforward\nto understand. Getting to it is tricky, and how they discovered\nit the first time is absolutely amazing. But once you've made it, it's a\nlot more straightforward to understand. So it's a lot more\nstraightforward to understand. In a magnetic coil, when you have\na round electrical coil, you have electrical current\nflowing in that coil. And if you have a conductor, if you\nhave another, a metal inside that coil, and this is called\nLenz's Law in one of the Maxwell equations, is that as you\nhave electrons and you have current flowing in that coil, an\nequal and opposite electrical current is induced in a piece\nof metal nearby. This is the same thing that happens in a transformer\nwhere you have a primary on a transformer and you have electricity flowing in it, and\nyou have a secondary where electricity flows exactly the opposite direction. We\nuse this every day in our lives. And so in this condition, you have a conductor, an electrical conductor\nwhere current can flow, and you have an electrical current flowing on the\noutside, electrical current flows on the inside. And in that case, now, I've\ndescribed two pieces of metal. Now let's go one step further and that inner\nconductor is not a piece of metal anymore. It's one of these high temperature\ngases, this plasma, this charged particles. So now you\nhave electrical current flowing in the plasma. This is\nreally, really interesting. We talked about these charges moving back\nand forth. Well, moving electrical charges is current. So in every plasma\ncondition we've talked about, the tokamak, the theta pinch, the\nstellarator, there's electrical current flowing in the plasma.\nBut in the field-reversed configuration, you have a lot of\nelectrical current flowing in the plasma, massive amounts of it. And\nthat's the key. So you have the center core where electrical\ncurrent is flowing in this transformer, if you want to think about\nit, primary and secondary. And here's the craziest part of it. This electrical current\n— Well, how did I describe a magnet? An electromagnet is a loop that has\nelectrical current flowing in it that generates a magnetic field.\nAnd for a theta pinch, and for a mirror and for a tokamak,\nin that magnetic field, the plasma gets trapped. But in an FRC, this electrical\ncurrent is the plasma. And that plasma plasma then generates\nits own magnetic field, and it's then trapped on\nits own magnetic field. - That's fascinating. - And that's the key. So, in your\ntokamak, in your donut, in your stell- in your funky donut, your stellarator- ...you make the magnets and\nyou trap your plasma in it. In an FRC, you make the plasma,\nwhich makes the magnets, and it traps itself. The craziest part of this, in my mind, is that we actually\nsee this in nature all the time. If you look at the sun, we\nsee solar flares. In a solar flare, we've all seen the pictures\nof the photosphere of the sun and this large arc of plasma coming out. That plasma has current, electrical\ncurrent flowing in it, and then we see this solar flare rip off of the sun. And that solar flare then can\nflow throughout and continue into the solar system, and for a little\nwhile anyway, it makes something called a plasmoid. That plasmoid is\nin fact electrical current flowing in the plasma, generating\na magnetic field and holding it for longer than it would otherwise.\nSo, we've observed these for 100 years, and we've known about these\nplasmoids for a long time, and there's researchers that have tried\nintentionally to make them. But fundamentally, that's what we\ndo every day, is make one of these self-organized closed-field plasmas. - in a more controlled way at this\nrapid rate of one-millionth of a second and being able to make sure\nit's reliable, stable, and all that kind of stuff. So, by the way,\nhow do you keep the thing stable? - And there's the hard part, because\nI just described a solar flare. But, and yes, we've seen the pictures of\nthem, but we've also watched them, and they appear. They fly away from the sun, and then\nthey go away, and that's not what we want in fusion, right? We want to be able to\ncontrol this. That's the hard part of the job. So, that's what we've\nspent the last number of years learning how to do,\nourselves and others, on these pulsed closed-field FRC systems. - Hm. - Let's first talk about how to make them, and\nthen we'll talk about how to make them stable, because they're two different things, and we\nspend a lot of time on both. So, we talked about timescales. You have to reverse the\nfield. You have to change the electrical current in a millionth of a second.\nSo, how do you do that? So, I've described this system as you\nhave a series of magnets. You have a magnetic field on the outside, and then\non the inside of this, you have this donut, this FRC that\nhas its own electrical current. We didn't talk about this yet,\nbut it's generated a magnetic field, and that magnetic field has pressure, and\nthis is the other thing that's really interesting. We talked\nabout how this theta pinch compresses a magnetic field.\nIt applies a pressure on the outside. But the\nplasma itself has a pressure on the inside, and it has both a particle\npressure, literally the particles bouncing. Think about hot gas\nin a balloon. The particles expanding, the ideal gas law expanding and\ncontracting inside a balloon. But they also have a magnetic pressure. The\nelectromagnetism is pushing back, and I like to think\nabout this as the motor in a Tesla. In your electric car, you have a motor, an electric motor, and what\nthat motor has is a series of windings. Those windings, you flow electrical\ncurrent, in this case from a battery. Hit the gas, electricity flows from\nthe battery into the motor into those windings, and it generates an\nelectromagnetic force. A Lorentz force is what it's technically\ncalled. This electromagnetic force induces an electrical current on the armature, on the shaft. This is\ngetting into the details, but in the armature of an electrical motor,\nthat actually is what spins. So the outside of a motor doesn't spin. You flow\nelectrical current through it, and the inside does spin. That electromagnetic\nforce is what is spinning that armature. In our case,\nwe're inducing an electrical force in that electromagnet, and\nthat's putting an electrical current, just like in the armature, into\nthat plasma. And we can use that force to do interesting\nthings. So that electromagnetic force can compress the fusion\nplasma. It can expand the fusion plasma. But here's the problem,\nit's unstable. So this is something you learn very early in\nyour graduate work as a student in fusion, is you learn about\nplasmas that are called high beta plasmas. - So I keep seeing this plasma\nbeta thing everywhere. What is this ratio of plasma field energy\nto confining magnetic field energy? Please explain. - Plasma beta is the ratio of the magnetic\npressure to the particle pressure. What that fundamentally means is\nI talked about how you have a magnetic field, and in that\nmagnetic field, plasma is trapped on that magnetic field. But it's not very well trapped. It can\nescape. It can leave either down the ends, it can freely travel,\nor it can also travel across the magnetic field.\nAnd so we have a term called plasma beta, which gives\nus an understanding of how well trapped that plasma is.\nSo, as you apply a magnetic pressure, a magnetic field to\nthis plasma, it pushes back, and does it push back a little or\ndoes it push back a lot? And for a field-reversed configuration,\nin one of our plasmas, beta is very close to one. In\nfact, usually by definition, one at any point in the system,\nwhich means that every time I apply a magnetic force on this\ndonut to compress it, the plasma particles on the inside push back. What's really interesting is you have an\nequation for magnetic pressure, which is B squared over 2μ0. The magnetic field squared is the external magnetic\npressure. Any magnetic field anywhere generates this\npressure. But the plasma particles themselves also have a\npressure. This is the ideal gas law, and we use the definition NKT: density, Boltzmann constant, and temperature\nfor pressure. And in high beta, they're the same. B squared\nover two mu naught is NKT. So for a known magnetic field, I know\nthe density and temperature of the plasma is. Just to circle back\nto it, when we talked about fusion, we talked about it having\nto be hot enough and dense enough. And that's N and that's T.\nSo now I have a very clear equation between magnetic field\nand density and temperature of the fusion fuel, and that's really\ncritical. All plasmas have some— all fusion plasmas\nhave some beta, some number. The FRC has one of the highest\nbetas, beta equal one. However, what you also learn in school when you learn\nabout beta the first time, is you learn that high-beta plasmas\nare typically unstable. And so the good way to think\nabout this is a tokamak is an accelerator that\nis stable, because those plasmas that are going around in\nthe donut, there's a force on that donut. But that plasma\ndonut is very well held by all those magnetic fields, by all\nthose magnetic coils. If it tried to move, it would be confined by\nthat magnetic coil. But in an FRC, it's unconfined. So the\nplasma is confined, but the whole topology can do something that\nis called tilt, is that this whole plasma donut, because it's\nunder pressure, can just turn over. The way I think about this\nis, think about a motor is a good example. An armature in the center\nof your motor, you have a spinning armature. You have this\nspinning magnet on the inside, and it is held by the main axis of the magnet. It can't go anywhere. We\ndon't have that axis. We don't have any mechanical things inside these fusion systems.\nThey're 100 million degrees. You can't put any mechanical things inside\nthem, and so we have nothing to hold onto it, and so it's unstable. So when you\nlearn about the FRC, that's the first thing you learn, and it took us a\nnumber of years to learn about a parameter of how to make\nthem stable, and that's pretty fundamental, but most\npeople who've heard of an FRC haven't understood this\nreally key fact. So we have a parameter we call S star\nover E. And we're getting really into the physics weeds here, but - Let's go. - it's really important, and the\ngood analogy here is a top. Literally a top, a spinning top, and\nso you have a top spinning on your desk. You know that it'll spin for a little\nwhile and then it will fall over. It is unstable. However, if you spin it\nfast enough, if you take a top and you spin it fast enough with enough\nangular momentum, enough angular inertia into that system,\nit'll stay upright even though it wants to just fall\nover, even though it's unstable. And we do the same thing in an\nFRC, is if you can drive it fast enough, if you can add enough\nkinetic energy and inertia to the particles, it will stay\nstable. However, you can do another really key\nthing. We are not limited now to having a very skinny top. We\ncan actually make it much bigger. So the good analogy here is if you have a\ncoin and you know you're spinning that coin, if you spin it faster and faster,\nit'll stay spinning longer. However, eventually it'll slow\ndown and fall over. But if you had a roll of duct tape, if you had\nsomething thicker and heavier and longer, and it's spinning around\nthat same axis, it'll stay spinning even longer, both because of\nthe inertia and because of the geometry. So we have this\nparameter called S star over E. S star is the hybrid kinetic parameter which\ntells you how stable it is from that top point of view, and the E,\nwhich is the elongation of how long it is. Maybe fortuitously, thank\nyou nature, gave us a win here, which is that how we make these in these\nlong solenoids is naturally very, very these long solenoids is\nnaturally very, very long. And so we can build\nthese with a very long lengths, and if we can drive\nthem fast enough and hard enough and drive the ions to\nmove at very high velocities, we can stabilize against those\ninstabilities and hold them stable. And so we now know we\ncan design with a given S star over E parameter, we can design\nthese for very long lives. The theory of the systems we\nmake say that they should last for a few microseconds at most. Us and others in the field have been\nable to make them last for thousands of microseconds, thousands of times\nwhat the stability criteria, the basic criteria would tell you. And\nso we know now how to do this, and so we just design them\nwith this built into them. - Can you explain a little bit more\nof the S star over E? Are you given that, or is that an emergent thing? So like at which stage, is\nthat the result or the requirement? - It's a great question. So\nit is a requirement of the system, is that you must design\nit with this parameter in mind. - Got it. - The hard part is you have to\ndesign it with S star over E being satisfied the whole time. - Right. - And here's the extra trick here. S star\nover E is also a measure of temperature. - Oh boy. - And, and, and, yup, we're, this, it\nall comes back to temperature. The hotter you make them is the same thing, temperature as kinetic\nenergy, is the faster you're spinning. So if you take your top and\nyou spin it faster, it's more stable. But you gotta make it\nhot, and so here's the trick. How do you make something hot that's\nstarting cold? And it has to be hot by definition, and so that's\npart of the challenge of what we do day-to-day, is getting\nto these hot plasmas, and where people have, other people have tried\nto make FRCs and not been very successful, is because they couldn't get it\nhot enough fast enough, is it fell over, it tilted, before it got hot.\nAnd so we spend a lot of our electrical engineering... In some ways, Helion is\nmore of an electrical engineering company than a fusion company some\ndays focusing on how to make the electronics fast\nenough to be able to get it hot enough soon enough that you\ncan keep it stable the whole time. - So you're trying to reach 100 million\ndegrees. How do you get to that temperature fast? And by the way, what can you say to help somebody like me understand\nwhat 100 million degrees is like? It seems insane.\nWhat does that world look like? I guess just everything is\nmoving really fast. Like you said, you can't put anything mechanical in there. - Yeah, so a couple of key things\nhappened. So when gas is that hot, there's... We talk about\nthe states of matter. You have solids, where ice, it's\ncold. The atoms are now bound in a lattice structure\ntogether. They're held together. And then liquid, you've broken a\nlot of that lattice structure. They can move around. They have some kinetic energy, but\nthey're still pretty contained, they stay in the bowl. Keep heating it, now\nyou're in gas. And now these particles are free to move around. They're\nbouncing off of each other all the time, and you can keep heating it from\nthere, and that's where we talk about some more phases of matter. We\ncan add a little bit more physics here. We talk about rarefied\ngases. When we think about most gases that humans\ninteract with, they act like a fluid. And what I mean by that is that\nthey're colliding with each other so often that the particles at any one place,\nhere the air is roughly the same temperature here the air is roughly the same\ntemperature as the air here. These particles are bouncing off of each other\nas if you've put a really hot one right here, it would then cool enough that\nall the air is roughly on the same temperature. But you can be what is called\nrarefied, and this is like space. This is where now you have particles\nmoving around, but they don't collide with each other very often. And so you can\nhave one very, very high energy particle and very cold energy particle, and they may not\neven touch each other, but maybe occasionally they bang into each other, they collide, and\nthen they transfer energy. That's where we call rarefied. And then you can go even hotter\nthan that, and that's where now the actual atomic states, which has the\nnucleus, which is a proton and a neutron, and an electron gets so\nhot, that electron gets energized and then escapes, leaves the system.\nAnd now they're charged. You have a positive nucleus and a negative\nelectron floating out, and that happens on the order of 10,000 degrees. So way hotter than what we're used\nto. But now, we're gonna go hotter. We're gonna take this plasma and go even hotter.\nWhat does that mean? At that point, a lot of the way we think about temperature doesn't\nreally apply. The idea that you have these random motion of particles,\nbecause now they're all individual particles moving at very high velocities. So\nthere really is a measurement of its velocity. So there really is a\nmeasurement of its velocity. It's really a measurement of how\nfast is that particle moving. And that's how I really\nthink about temperature when you get to that 100,000,000\ndegrees. And so it does some more complex things. If you have\nthis high energy particle... This is why we like fusion. It's moving at a\nhigh velocity and there's another one moving at high velocity. They will come together,\nthey will collide, and they will fuse. But other things will happen. You don't\nwant to touch that high-velocity particle with any kind of material, 'cause it will\ncollide with that material, damage that material and usually, like, blow\noff some chunks of that material. So we don't do that. We keep those charged\nparticles in a magnetic field. So they just bounce around and they don't ever touch\nanything. That's really important. And so it's less thinking about it from\nthe way we normally think about hot and cold, and more thinking about it\nfrom a velocity point of view. - So what we should be imagining is extremely\nfast moving, what is it? 1,000,000 miles per hour? Is that accurate? - That's the right kind of\norder for these systems. - Crazy. So you're looking for them\nto collide. First of all, to get back, is there some\ninteresting insights, tricks, anything you could say to the\ncomplexity of the problem of getting it to that high temperature quickly? - So, if temperature is velocity, that means they're moving quickly\nover a given amount of space. Speed is distance divided by\ntime. And so if you have a machine of a certain size and it's\nmoving very fast, that tells you the time that that particle's moving\nfrom place to place in that machine. And, in fact, if it's\na million miles per hour, these are on the order of\n100 kilometers per second, which you can flip that around and\nyou can say you're moving at meters per microsecond. So feet\nper millionth of a second. And so that fundamentally tells you, and we've\nknown this, as soon as you say, \"I want to do fusion,\" you know you need to react\nto the universe in microseconds and be able to understand the system\nin that speed. And if you get it hotter, it goes even faster,\nand you have to go faster. And so we look at those and that's how\nwe think about the systems. We measure everything in microseconds, not in\nseconds. And so when you do fusion, it's pretty wild. It's literally\na flash. Pshh, fusion happens. And it's over. You start\nit, you do a lot of fusion, you recover energy from it, and\nthen you turn it off before the human eye can really respond even. - And there's a computer managing all this.\nLike, how do you even program these kinds of systems to do the switching? Is\nthere some innovation required there? - So I'm continuously amazed by\nwhat the pioneers in fusion were able to do before the computer existed,\n'cause they had to control things at this scale. But maybe it was\npretty hard and why we've been able to be... take what they did\nand build on it, because now we use modern gigahertz-scale\ncomputing to be able to do this. And so even when I\nstarted my career, we talked about, like, megahertz processors. Megahertz\nis microseconds. That's great. You're kind of at the border of\nfast enough, but you can't do computation at that speed if\nall it can do is respond in one microsecond. But now gigahertz\nmeans I can do a thousand operations in that one microsecond,\nso I can do more useful things. So we use mostly...\nThis is way too fast for any human to respond to, so we use\nwhat's called programmable logic. So we program in\nsequences to the fusion system to be able to do this\nreversal. We pre-program it and then we run a sequence and then\nfusion happens. And so in this sequence programming language,\nwe use a variety of them. Some of the fusion codes are actually\nwritten in Fortran still. - Nice. - And though a lot is now, more and\nmore are run in Python. And so we do a lot of Python. We do some Java,\nand then we also have because of the speed of this, it's a lot of\nassembly language programming. So we go right to the assembly\nlevel of the programmable logic FPGAs and we program those. And\nso to be able to run one of these systems, we typically have a series\nof electrical switches that turn on this electrical current.\nThose are controlled via fiber optic because the wires are just too\nslow. So fiber optic I can respond, I can send photons at the speed of light.\nAnd so those fiber optics can respond in nanoseconds. And then I trigger\nthose fiber optics with programmable logic that we programmed\nin the hardware assembly language. - As a small tangent, let me do a call to action out there. I'm\nstill looking for the best Fortran programmer in the world. If people to talk to them, 'cause so many of the\nessential systems the world runs on is still programmed in Fortran. I think\nit's a fascinating programming language. Cobol too, but Fortran even more\nso. It's one of the great sort of computational numerical programming\nlanguages. Anyway, what in terms of the sensors that are giving you some kind of information\nabout the system, in terms of the diagnostics, like what\nkind, at this time scale... ...what can you collect about the\nsystem such that you can respond at the similar time scale? - So I'm also calling out for Fortran\nprogrammers, for different reasons. - Yes, great. - The diagnostic systems is\nreally one of the keys to how we do this effectively, because\nyou need to be able to tell the system, \"We're going to trigger electrical\ncurrent and we're going to do it in a microsecond, and we need to know\nif it's working right.\" And so in one of these FRC,\nor these pulsed magnetic systems, you won't have just one\nelectrical switch. I've mentioned 100 mega amps, 100 million amps of\nelectrical current. Even the big transistors we use can\nonly run at 30,000 amps, so you'll end up with tens of thousands.\nIn fact, the systems we build now, tens of thousands of parallel electrical\nswitches all operating in harmony together. And so you need to be able\nto build a system, and this is what we spend a lot of time with. And\nI made the joke that in a lot of ways Helion's an electrical\nengineering company. to be able to both program, control, and then detect how they're\noperating, and do it all very fast. So in a typical\nsequence, we will pre-program. The operators will pre-program\na sequence usually fed from a numerical simulation of\nexpecting how the fusion system will perform. We start with a set\nof calculations. We then pre-program all of these electrical switches\nto a certain sequence to be able to inject the fuel, reverse\nit, and then compress it up to fusion conditions. And\nthen we trigger that, and then let it go, and\nmeasure fusion happening. But during that process,\nwe have to be real time recording and measuring all\nof the semiconductors and all of the switching in the system. I'm not going\nto talk about measuring fusion diagnostics. That's a whole other thing, which we can talk\nabout. This is just on the electrical control side. And so some of the pioneering\nthings we've been able to do is that real-time you're\nmonitoring all of these switches. You're watching who is\ntriggering correctly, who is not triggering correctly. And if systems\naren't working, you're shutting down this because you want to make sure\nthat all the sequences are operating correctly. So, some of the key\ndiagnostics, it's actually pretty amazing that even early in\nmy career, we didn't have a lot of fiber optics built into the\nsystem. And now it's absolutely essential. And so, every one of these electrical switches\nhas fiber optic signals going into it and fiber optic signals coming\nout, understanding how it's actually operating. And real-time, all of these systems are being\nmonitored by more fiber optics. We call these Rogowski coils, but\nthey're electromagnetic coils that are powered by the electrical current\nthemselves. So as the switches are conducting, they broadcast a signal\nthat says, \"Yes, I'm electrically conducting an optical signal,\" fiber\noptics that come back to a central repository where we detect\nthose signals. And so, real-time, we're monitoring all of this\nso that we know that these systems are behaving and operating at\ntheir optimal performance. - What's the role of numerical simulation in\nall of this? Sort of, I guess, ahead of time, how much numerical\nsimulation are you doing to understand how the system is going to\nbehave, how the different parameters all come together? The electrical\nsystem and how that all maps to the fusion that's actually generated? - Yeah. The operation of a fusion\nsystem is pretty fascinating because all of this happens on a time scale where\nhuman operators cannot be involved. cannot really be involved. And so,\nyou have to have pre-programmed the majority, we call them shots. You're going\nto do a shot, and when you're operating them repetitively and you're running long periods\nof time, you still have all computers doing both the triggering and\nthe measuring of how they're performing, real-time the whole time. And so, how this typically\nworks, at least in our systems, is that we will\ndesign a system with a combination of some numerical\nsimulation tools that we've developed based off\nof decades and decades of amazing government programs.\nNational programs developed these numerical codes. We use a code called an\nMHD, magnetohydrodynamic code. And that's, for people, for the engineers\nout there who are used to CFD, computational fluid dynamics.\nThis is very similar where you take the same sets of\nequations actually and add electromagnetic equations on top of those.\nAnd so you get magnetohydrodynamic. - Are you simulating at the level of a particle?\nIs there some quantum mechanical aspects to this also? How low does it go? - Yeah, we have multiple codes at\ndifferent levels, because one of the main computational challenges is, amazingly,\neven given all that we have been, have built, for fusion systems,\ncomputers are still not fast enough to measure, to simulate\neverything. And so, we have a number of codes that we use. One\nwe call fluid codes, where you treat the ions, the electrons, all these\nfusion particles. You treat them as as fluids, as gases, ideal\ngas law, with electromagnetic forces. In those, we can\nsimulate not just the fusion fuel, which is important, but all of\nthe electrical circuitry. We talked about capacitors and magnetic coils, and\nthe electrical current and the switches. We actually simulate the full\nthing, starting literally with a SPICE model. More of that electrical\nengineering. We start with the SPICE model and use that to drive the\nplasma physics model, and that's one level of simulation. We use that to\ndo design work, and then also to try to understand how we think the machine will\nrun. But then we go one level deeper and we start thinking about particles, and\nwe think about the ions, and we treat the ions as particles, and we look at\nthe ion behavior. For that one, the computational resources are several\norders of magnitude larger. Luckily, a lot of the work in GPUs, the AI data center work is directly\napplicable to those simulations. It's been able to speed up our work, which\nis pretty fascinating. That's a whole other tangent we can go down. Those hybrid codes we call them,\nparticle and cell codes now treat the ions as particles,\nand that lets us measure and simulate the behavior. I mentioned the\nstability criteria, S star over E, the top behavior. That behavior, we now need\nthese more advanced codes to be able to simulate, and those are more modern.\nWe've only been able to apply in practice for the last few years,\nactually, which is pretty fascinating. The old stability rules were built off of testing, empirical tests,\nwhere now we can simulate that, and we know why they work and how they\nwork, and we can do some predictions on them. And so, that's really fascinating that\nwe've been able to push those boundaries. - And what are the different variables you're\nplaying with? Are you still playing with like topology? Like, what are the\ndifferent variables in- in play here? - Yeah. Each of the different\nsimulations we analyze and use it to design different parts of\nthe machine. So, at the MHD level where we have the SPICE, where we\nactually have the circuit model, our design team uses this to design\nthe circuitry, where we're designing which capacitor to use,\nwhich switch to use, how many cables to use, literally to that level,\nhow big of a cable to use. So as we're doing power plant designs right now,\nthose are the tools we're using today, every day, the team is using.\nThen you can go one level deeper and say, \"Okay, let's use these\nmore advanced computational tools about stability to say, \"Okay,\ngreat, but I now know the circuitry, but let's look at the magnetic\nfield topology. How do I design the magnet, the shape of the magnet\nexactly, the timing of the magnet exactly? I have to trigger one magnet, and the\nnext magnet next to it, and the next magnet next to it. How do I\nhave that shape and that design?\" And so that's where you're using\nthose more advanced tools. Now, those unfortunately, those are still too slow. And so, those\nsimulations may take a day or two to run. And so, an operator\nright now does a lot of simulations ahead of time, then\ncollects data through their operations of the machines,\nmaking these field-reversed configurations, going through\nparameter sweeps. And then the simulation team then goes back and\nlooks at that data and compares it with simulations. I'm really excited about\nsome of the things we're seeing in artificial intelligence and\nreinforced learning to be able to speed up that process. So we're\nwatching and starting to work on that now: can we now, rather than\nusing it where we use it today, where we do a simulation\nto design a machine or a test, run the test, and then over\nthe next couple of days compare the testing with the simulation and use that to\ninform what we're going to run for the next set of tests. But in fact, do it more\nreal-time, where an operator can pull up what the AI or what\nthe machine learning would have predicted it should have done. And then\nuse that to understand what's happening in the actual programs, in the\nactual generators themselves. - All right. So there's a million\nquestions there. So first of all, how much understanding\ndo we have about how many collisions happen? Can\nwe go to the fusion? How many collisions are\nthere and how does that map to the electricity? And maybe\ncan you just even speak to the directly mapping to the electricity,\nwhich is one of the differences between this approach and\nthe tokamak approach? - So how much fusion do you get out\nfrom these systems? And that's really the right key question. So we\nalready talked about beta, that B squared, the magnetic pressure,\nis equal to NKT, N being the density, T being temperature.\nAnd then we talked about fusion, where your goal for fusion\nis to get particles hot, high temperature, get\nenough of them together, density. And then you want to get\nthem together long enough. We call that tau. So N, T,\nand tau, long enough that fusion happens, and a lot of fusion\nhappens, more than any of the loss rates that are happening, NTT.\nAnd in beta with B squared, you know already two of those\nparameters, NNT, are equal. And so that tells you right\naway the goal is to maximize magnetic field, absolutely maximize magnetic\nfield. And most folks in magnetic fusion, whether it's a tokamak or\nit's Theta Pinch or it's an FRC, are attempting to do that, maximize the\nmagnetic field. So we're all pushing to that. What's really nice in pulse systems\nis that we know how to do that. In fact, In a pulse system, researchers\nin pulsed magnetic fields have demonstrated over 100 tesla\nmagnetic fields in pulsed magnets. That's much\nhigher than you can get in a steady magnet, or what's\nbeen demonstrated so far. - Just a clarification question.\nSo maximizing magnetic field is about the N and the T, the beta?\nSo we're not talking about tau yet. - Not yet, but we need to, because\nthat's really important. We can even talk a little bit further\nabout how fusion scales. And so in fusion, the hotter you get\nthe fuel, the more fusion you get. And we know that by\nincreasing the magnetic field, B squared as NT, you\nincrease density and temperature together. More density, more temperature is\nmore fusion, plus more temperature is even more fusion. And so what we see is\nthat in our, in these types of systems, a scaling\nvery clearly of magnetic field to the 3.75 power, or even in a lot of demonstrations, 3.77.\nThat specific scaling. That's a very strong scaling\nof fusion power output, and fusion reactions. And so that\ntells you you want to go to a maximum magnetic field as you can. Pulsed systems\nare really powerful. Pulsed systems have showed when you do pulsed magnetic\nfields compared to a steady magnetic field, researchers have shown over\n100 Tesla magnetic fields. Where in a steady system, people\nhave showed in the 20, maybe high 20 Tesla systems. And\nif it's B to the 3.77 power, already you can see massive fusion\npower outputs by doing a pulsed system. - Okay, got it. So we're maximizing\nthe magnetic field. So that's going number go up, super up. How\ndo you get the duration, the tau? - But then I said pulsed, and pulsed\nalready implies shorter tau. - Yes. - And so that is in the fusion\nfield the name of the game. Folks will have a very inertial fusion. We'll have a nanosecond\ntau. Very short, but then very high pressure. They don't have\nmagnetic fields, but very high pressure. And then in stellarators\nand Tokamaks, your goal is very long tau, but you'll\nhave much lower density and you can't really go too much in\ntemperature, but they'll have much lower density. And so where we live\nin the pulsed magnetic, or the magneto-inertial fusion\nis in the middle, is in extremely high magnetic fields, increasing\npressure as much as you can, and then keeping them around long\nenough. And so that gets to the tau. That gets to that\nenergy confinement lifetime, and also, it gets to stability.\nAnd so this is the thing that this field-reversed configuration,\nwhich has showed that we can build. These plasmas can last for hundreds or thousands of times the\nbasic theory has shown that now you can have long enough\nlifetimes. So what that means is in a practical fusion system that\nthere are lifetimes of these high beta pulse systems\nbetween 100 microseconds and a few milliseconds, thousandths of a\nsecond. And you hold onto it for a few thousandths of a second. You do\nfusion, and then you exhaust it. And so the whole process\nin this is we start with a magnetic field that fills the\nfull chamber. You then inject fusion fuel. You ionize\nit, superheating it now to a nice, cold one\nmillion degrees. But hot enough that you have charged\nparticles. You have plasmas. You can then start increasing\nthe magnetic field. You form a field-reversed configuration,\nand then rapidly increase the magnetic field further. Increasing from one to five to\n10, 20, to even higher magnetic fields. And as you do\nthat, the plasma heats. You compress it, increasing\nthe field and pressure. Fusion is now happening. New\ncharged particles are being born inside this system with a tremendous\namount of heat and energy. but in charged particles.\nThis is where the beta really, really works to your advantage, is that just like magnetic pressure on\nthe outside, magnetic pressure is NKT compresses compresses the fuel in increasing pressure\nand temperature. When the pressure and temperature of the plasma\nincrease, NKT increases. It pushes back on the magnetic field,\nincreasing the magnetic field on the outside of the plasma,\nand what that does is magnetic field is electromagnetic current,\nand current running in a wire. And what that does is pushes current\nback in the wire. So the plasma itself now pushes back on the magnetic\nfield, pushing electrical current out of the system and recharging the\ncapacitors where we started this whole process. - all in a self-organizing way.\nSo I think it's good to sort of clarify how fusion usually\ngenerates energy, where this intermediate step of heating\nup water, then the steam is the thing that leads to\nelectricity. And then, of course, the FRC method that you use leads directly\nto electricity. I was wondering if you could describe the\ndifference between those two. - Yeah. I like the analogy of the\nmatch and the campfire, and I hear that a lot in fusion. Where a lot of what steady fusion, think a stellarator\nor a Tokamak, is attempting to do is take a little bit of fuel,\nthat match, and then add heat to ignite that match, and then put it with enough fuel\nand in the right conditions and hold onto it for a long time that\nit grows into a campfire. Even if they do a good job, a bonfire. It's creating a tremendous amount\nof energy in that steady system. Burning fuel in the same\nplace, generating some ash, generating a lot of heat\nin that reaction. And in a traditional, in a Tokamak or\na stellarator, that's a lot of what you're doing, is you're holding\nonto the heat as much as possible to keep that reaction going. And the optimal fuel is called deuterium\nand tritium, where you have... Deuterium is a heavy isotope of\nhydrogen where you have an extra neutron, and tritium is a\nvery rare form of hydrogen that's an unstable form. It's so\nrare it's hard to get. Where it has two neutrons and a proton, and\nwhen you fuse those together at very high temperatures at very high densities or high enough densities\nand very high temperatures they make helium, which is a charged\nparticle, which stays inside the campfire, inside the\nTokamak continuing to heat it and stoke the flames, and\nit makes a neutron which leaves the system because it's\nuncharged. It has no charge, and in that system, it's actually ideal. It's\nreally great because in a campfire, you have this reaction going and you want to\nget the energy out of it. You wanna use it, and you don't want to just burn up all\nthe fuel and do nothing. That's not really valuable. What's really valuable is to\nstand next to the campfire and get the heat, get what comes off of it. And then use that in a\ntraditional fusion system to... boil water, to heat the\nwater, and then at 30, 35% efficiency, then convert that through\na steam turbine into a cooling tower, and cool off the fuel\nand extract electricity. And we know steam turbines.\nCoal plants do this. Nuclear fission reactors do this. And so\nwe know how to do that, and that's the traditional way of doing it. But I think there are other ways to\ndo it with a pulsed magnetic system. There's one more thing you get\nto do because you have this high beta where there's an electric field and\nan electromagnetic force that's now compressing the fusion\nfuel. It's increasing in temperature. It's getting hotter. It's\nincreasing in temperature. Density fusion is happening. New fusion particles are\nbeing born, and those particles are not just stoking the flame. They're not\njust holding onto the campfire like in the Tokamak, but they're doing another thing which is\nreally powerful, which is they're pushing back on the magnetic field. They're applying a pressure.\nThat pressure induces a current. We can extract that electrical current. But it takes you into another direction,\nso your analogy of the campfire now breaks down, because now the campfire is\nexpanding. It's pushing back on something, and so now it's the analogy\nof the piston engine. As you move from the match,\nthe campfire, to now pistons. And so, in a piston engine,\nyou use the motion of the piston, the pressure on it and\nthe motion of it to do something useful, and in a piston engine,\nit's to turn a crankshaft and turn a crankshaft and run a... Run wheels,\nor maybe even a piston engine to turn a crankshaft and run a generator\nand make electricity. And in fact, you can do it\npretty high efficiency. and a generator using\nthat method, using the expansion of that piston, and what\nwe do is use the expansion of the magnetic field to extract that\nelectricity, and we believe you can do it at much, much higher efficiencies.\nIn fact, there have been theoretical papers that show not 30 to 35% efficiency like a steam turbine can\ndo, but 80% efficiency. 85% efficiency, extracting much more of\nthe energy of the fuel in that process. - Can you actually just take a tiny\ntangent... On the word efficiency here? So, yeah, so you said 30%, so it's inefficient, and that efficiency\nmeasure is how much of the energy is actually\nconverted to electricity? - That measure is how much of\nthe thermal energy that gets outside of the system is then converted into\nelectricity, which is the thing we care about. We want... we're not in this\nto make fusion. We're in this to make electricity. And we're using fusion to make electricity,\nand so from my point of view, that should be the focus: how do we get to\nthat? So that's the efficiency of that thermal energy that makes\nit out to electricity. What it is not a measure of how much energy you\nput into the system and what happens to that in terms of you started\nthis campfire with a blowtorch. What about all that blowtorch\nenergy? What are you getting for that? And so I think that's something\nthat high beta is one more side benefit that it turns out is actually maybe the\ntail that wags the dog, is that not only do you at high efficiency get out any of\nthe new fusion energy, which is great, because that's what you want, make electricity from\nfusion, but you also get to recover all of that magnetic energy\nyou put back into it. And that's the really powerful one,\nand that's something that folks have demonstrated over 95%\nefficiency, that you can put electricity into fusion and then\nget that electricity back out at 95% efficiency, plus some very high efficiency, maybe 80%, maybe higher\nof all the fusion product electricity too. So now you're making a tremendous\namount of electricity in one of these systems, and that has all kinds\nof performance and engineering benefits that are really powerful, but\nit also pushes you to other fuels. So we talked about how deuterium and\ntritium fuels make this neutron, which leaves the system to\nboil water, to run steam turbines, but it doesn't push back on\nthe magnetic field. So in one of these high beta systems, it's actually\nnot a great fuel at all, and so the other fuels that are out there are\neven more interesting, and one of the candidate fuels that's really interesting\nis called deuterium and helium-3. And we talked about deuterium,\nheavy hydrogen. Well, helium-3, the nucleus is also called a helion.\nThat's why we named the company that. is light helium, which is... In normal helium, which is what you find in a\nballoon, there's two protons, two neutrons. It's very stable and found\ncommonly. Helium-3 is also stable, but it's not found commonly.\nFortunately, it's lightweight, so it leaves. It literally leaves\nthe atmosphere and goes into space. So we don't have a lot of it here\non Earth, and so you have to make it, or you have to go into space, and there's a\nwhole other thing about where do you get it? Do you get it from the moon? Jupiter\nhas, it turns out, massive amounts of helium-3. But when you take deuterium and helium-3 and you fuse those\ntogether, you also get that helium particle, that alpha\nparticle, what we call that in fusion. But instead of the neutron,\nyou get a proton, and that proton is a charged particle.\nIt's a hydrogen nucleus. That proton is now trapped in the magnetic\nfield, pushes back, and you can extract that electricity. Now, there are some prices to be\npaid for this helium-3 fuel. But for a high beta system for this helium-3 fuel. But for a high beta system like a\npulsed magnetic fusion system, that's really the ideal fuel. like a pulsed magnetic fusion system,\nthat's really the ideal fuel. - When you say prices, what are the\nprices? What shape do the prices take? What, what are the prices? What shape\ndo the prices take? prices take? - All kinds of shapes: physics, engineering,\ntechnical, and business costs. And so, let's dive in. So, we talked about how helium-3 is...\nFrom the fusion physics point of view, from the fusion physics point of view,\nwe talked about 100 million degrees. That's the temperature that deuterium and tritium\nfusion works really well. And that's the temperature fusion works really well. And that's the temperature\nthat traditional fusion folks have really focused that traditional fusion folks have really\nfocused on getting to. That's the threshold. When you get to 100 million degrees, you're at the operating\npoint of fusion, and you know it works, colloquially anyway. of fusion, and you know it\nworks, colloquially anyway. Helium-3 requires higher temperatures.\nThat's not enough. Fusion happens That's not enough. Fusion happens for\ndeuterium and helium-3 at 100 million degrees, degrees, but it's not its optimal temperature.\nAnd in fact, in a high beta system, the optimal the optimal temperature is higher: 200,\neven sometimes 300 million degrees. So you have to get to even higher temperatures.\nTemperature's hard, and so you have to push Temperature's hard, and so you have to push to\neven higher temperatures than you had before. And so that's one of the downsides. The\nother downside can be, as you get to those The other downside can be, as you\nget to those higher temperatures, we talked about B squared is NT. B\nsquared is density times temperature. is density times temperature. Well, for a given magnetic\nfield, density and temperature are now inverse. field, density and temperature are now inverse.\nSo as I increase temperature, density decreases. So as I increase temperature, density\ndecreases. And so now you have an issue An issue of you may have less particles to\ndo fusion, which means your fusion system to do fusion, which means your fusion system\nhas to get bigger than it was before. So for the same reaction\nrates, a helium-3 system compared to deuterium-tritium, has to operate\nat a higher temperature and be bigger. However, the flip side is if you\ncan now recover energy at 80, recover energy at 80, at three times the\nenergy efficiency, at 80 some percent at 80 some percent versus 30 some percent,\nand recover all your input energy, then now it's actually\nabout the same size. Because they're the same electricity output, not\nenergy. It's not energy that we're worried about. It's electricity we're worried about.\nElectricity output, now you can actually actually build systems of similar size and similar\nenergy. Only they're now at this much higher efficiency. Only they're now at this\nmuch higher efficiency. - Got it. Can you say more about size?\nWhat are we talking about here? Why is size an important constraint? - And that gets to one of the other\nprices. That gets to money. Our goal is we want to build clean, low-cost\nelectricity and get it out in the world. low-cost electricity and get it out in the\nworld, but that means it needs to be low-cost. That's fundamental. If it's really\nexpensive, no one's going to buy it. And, while it can be clean, it's not\ngoing to be deployed. And so that is always has to be a part of why, what the\npromise of fusion is that can be low cost. So how do we know how much fusion\nsystems cost? That's a really great question. And a lot of it\ncomes down to fundamental size, that you have to just build\nthings. And so there's some really first principles, cost engineering\nyou can do around power plants for fundamentally what do they\ncost? How much concrete went into it? Fundamentally, how\nbig is it? And that, and that if you're doing a\ngood job of manufacturing, you are, your goal is to\nmanufacture a product for as low of cost as you can so you\ncan sell it for as low price as you can. It asymptotes to the material cost. - Ah. - Because you never get cheaper than that. - So this literally, in some sense,\nsome sort of first principle sense is how much concrete- - How- how- - ...goes into building the power plant. - How much concrete, how\nmuch steel, how much, copper and aluminum. Different\nmaterials cost different amounts, but at the end of the day, the cheapest\nfunction is the least amount of materials. - Wow. Okay. - And so that's, we think a lot about that\nand how we can make these systems smaller so they can be developed at lower cost. Now,\nthere's a flip side. You still need to produce electricity. So if you make them really small and they don't\nproduce electricity, and there is some minimum size to fusion, and that's really important.\nFusion scientists and engineers don't see you'd ever have a\nfusion generator on the back of your DeLorean, for instance. The\nphysics doesn't let that one happen, at least physics as we've understood for\nthe last, you know, 100 or 200 years. - Well, there's a lot of really interesting\nbusiness questions here, because you're basically at the cutting edge of science,\nof technology, of physics, of engineering trying to basically innovate into\nthe future rapidly. How do you how do you do that? Because the R&D here,\nthe research alone is a lot of money. So what's, I mean, what can\nyou say about that? How to be bold and fearless in pushing this\ntechnology into the future when so much is unknown and it costs so\nmuch to just do the research? - So I think about this in a couple of ways.\nOne, the need. We look to the world and we know the world needs clean, low-cost, safe electricity. And\njust to meet our needs today, and not to even talk about the\nneeds of tomorrow or the needs of AI or any of the growth that's probably\ncoming. Just to meet today. And so, but fundamental to that is it has to\nbe a product that people will buy. It has to be a generator that\nis making that electricity at low cost. And it's got to be soon. And so a lot of what I think about\nis how do we do those two things together? And a lot of that is scale, and a lot of that is thinking about... And\nnot big scale. In fact, it's the opposite of that. It's small scale. It's how\ndo you build a product that's mass producible, that you can build\nquickly and learn quickly? And what I've found in my career at this is that they're actually\nthe same thing. And that the faster you can build a thing,\nthe faster you can learn if that thing works, the faster\nyou can now you can actually iterate on that and\nbuild the next thing. And so what I have spent my career building is\nteams of humans and a company that are builders, that can build\nhigh technology things quickly. That if you want\nto do R&D, you don't want large scale, multinational, complex, huge systems. You want to actually take\nthe smallest thing you can build that accomplishes the mission, and\nin fusion, there is a minimum size, but accomplishes the mission, and then build it\nquickly and build whole teams around building it quickly and incentivize\nfolks to move quickly, iterate and learn. And the irony I think of one of the things that I've\ndiscovered is that by focusing on manufacturing, by\nfocusing on low cost, very rapid manufacturing, you\nactually get to do science faster, and at the beginning of my\ncareer, I would never have guessed that. I would have thought the way\nto do science is to make a giant demonstration particle accelerator\nsomewhere. Like to make a large complex science experiment is the best way to\ndo science. And what I've found is actually small iterative, just\nbuilding as fast as possible gets you there faster, because you can learn,\nyou can build, you can iterate. You can solve the problems, and then\nyou can learn the fundamental physics, learn the scaling,\nlearn the FRC, and the B to the 3.77 power\nand learn those things way sooner than if you would have\njust started on one mega project and then waited decades\nto get to the answer. - There's a profound truth in that,\nsomething about the constraints of pushing for the simple,\nfor the low cost, for the manufacturable. That pushes everything,\npushes the science, pushes the innovation. In fact, you should maybe\nexplain that you're, I believe, on the seventh prototype.\nThis is insane. The rate of innovation here is\ninsane. Can you maybe speak to all the different prototypes\nyou went through, what it took to just iterate rapidly? And maybe\nit would be really interesting for people, like what can you\nsay about the teams that's required to make that\nhappen? Like what kind of people are required to make\nthat happen at that fast rate? And we're not talking\nabout, like, software here. We're talking about\neverything, the full stack. All the way down to the physics\nat 100 million degrees. At speeds of one million miles per\nhour. It's insane. Anyway, so what, How do you iterate the prototypes, and\nwhat kind of teams make it happen? - So at Helion, we've- we've built seven\nsystems. The first six were a series of prototypes that we built end\nto end that were focused on scaling the process of\nmaking these field- reverse configurations, compressing\nthem to thermonuclear fusion conditions, and demonstrating that you\ncan do fusion and then increasing the scale, increasing the temperature\nand the energy. The very first ones were named after beer. Actually the most\nsuccessful was the inductive plasmoid accelerator, the IPA. And it\nwas the first system that showed that the team could make these FRCs and hold onto them and\nunderstand some of the stability criteria, the heating\ncriteria. And then we started increasing the field. Now, okay,\ngreat, we can hold onto one of these FRCs. We know how long and how to make them,\nbut now can we squeeze on them and start doing fusion? Increasing in\npressure and temperature. What we noticed is- is you know, machine\nafter machine, we always used Starbucks. We were in\nRedmond at the time, Redmond, Washington, and Starbucks cups\nsitting on top of the machine as the, this is the scale. They were too small to have a human really\nin the picture all the time, so the Starbucks cup was enough. And so\nthen we switched to Tall, Grande, venti. And then the\nbiggest, trenta, was the biggest system that came online in 2020. That was a system that showed 100\nmillion degrees and was the first system that did deuterium and helium-3 fusion.\nIn fact, as far as we know, the only bulk deuterium-helium-3\nfusion that has been done and also showed the 100-million-degree\nfusion temperatures from an FRC. And throughout that time, the earliest\nwork was government funded, government grants, SBIRs and other type of\ngovernment grants. And- and actually the team involved myself and the\nrest of the founding team were really good at winning\ngovernment programs, doing fundamental science, but\nmoving very quickly. And there's a lot of ways to think about how to iterate\nand how to build quickly. I want to talk about the teams first, and then we can talk\nabout some of the technology- ...uses to do that. But a lot of it is thinking about if your goal is to\nget the product, electricity out to the world as soon as possible,\nthen you should be looking at everything you do towards that\nlens. And so that's thinking about the materials you choose.\nYou want to, at every turn, choose commonly available materials. If\nyou have to wait for supply chain for an ultra-rare material, it's gonna\ntake you a lot more time. And so do everything you can to engineer\na system that uses simple aluminum alloys, simple copper alloys. And\nif you have to use tungsten, and maybe you have to use tungsten in some of\nyour systems, which is a hard-to-find alloy- make sure you're using commonly\navailable thicknesses of tungsten sheet. You know, those kinds of engineering\nanalyses and thought processes at every step. And that's how we\nbuilt these systems, from IPA to Venti up to Trenta, was always looking at, \"How do we build\nsystems that are easy to build and mass produced?\" Because this is the other\nthing that I don't know that early in my career I'd have predicted is that by making a hundred of a thing, you can actually make\nit faster than if you go make one of a thing. And that's because\nwhen you look at our fusion systems, we talked about these\nbig magnets. You could build one giant big, complex, hard-to-make magnet that's\nheavy and you have to move it around with a crane and requires very complex machining\nby ultra-rare CNCs. Or, you could then make that out of a composite\nof 100 smaller magnets. Each of those magnets now can be made on a\nsimple machine. Each of these magnets can be picked up by a human, they're\nlight enough. They can be made and manufactured and mass produced. And\nthat's what we did. And that was our whole design philosophy on\nthese machines is, at every turn, how do we go faster? A classic one that still to this day I push the team on\nis, again, thinking about how do you move fast, eBay. We buy, and I don't know\nthat I've ever said this publicly, - Oh boy, here we go. This is great. - we spend a lot of time on eBay. - You've got to find a way, yeah. - You've got to move. And here's\nan example. We use a vacuum pump because in these systems you've\ngot to pull out all the air. So we use a vacuum pump called a\nturbomolecular vacuum pump. This is a commodity. This is used in a variety\nof particle accelerators, scientific applications. There are many of them.\nThey're robust. They last a long time. They also have a very small supply chain. So if you want to buy a\nbrand new turbomolecular pump, you can, and you might wait nine\nmonths from the manufacturer to go make one for you and deliver\nit for you. But I can go today and get the same model that was made\n10 years ago and get it on eBay today, right now. However, it might not\nwork. Like you don't know how well it works or how clean it is, or\nany of those things. And so what we do is, you don't go to eBay\nto save money. It does. It's cheaper, turbo pumps that are sitting\nin eBay right now, bring those Bring those in-house, test them. Maybe only\none of them meets the specifications you need, but guess what? You just got a pump\nin two weeks instead of nine months. And you got it, and it's in the door,\nand it's operational, and it's running, and you're moving. - See, I love this. I love that\nkind of stuff. One of the only people I've really seen do that\nis Elon. He put together that cluster in Memphis in a matter of weeks, which\nis nothing like that has ever been done before. And this eBay way is really the kind of thing that's\nrequired to make that happen, as you shortcut the supply chain. - And everywhere you can, you still have\nto deliver the working product, right? - Right. - That is, you cannot\nsacrifice the quality. But do you really need the shiny\nbrand-new one when the used one is going to do the job? And we think\nabout that across the board. Do we take the best plasma\ndiagnostic, the most sophisticated plasma diagnostic in the world that\nis 3%, that has an accuracy of within 3%? And it's going to take me three\nyears and maybe a few million dollars to go build? Or do I\ntake a technology from 10 years ago that's 5% accurate,\nthat's good enough, that I can go build in a month?\nAnd the answer for us, at Helion and for the team that we've\nput together, is that scrappy, \"I want to just solve the problem.\nI don't need necessarily the best solution, but let's go make it happen.\" And so that's something that we\nroutinely do. I think sometimes I have challenges with my academic\ncolleagues on this, is that we have a difference of opinion. Because that\n3%, well, that's way better than 5%. So shouldn't you do that? You'll know\nyour data better. But 5% is good enough. Now, 50% would not be\ngood enough. And so that technology wouldn't have been applicable.\nAnd so finding that middle ground is a hard thing to do, and never\ncompromising on the quality and the safety. Like, it's got to work and it's\ngot to be safe. But can you still go fast? - But in general, just having a culture\nof pushing the rate of iterations here. - Mm-hmm. And building the team\nthat wants to go build things. Everyone at Helion, or at least\nthe vast majority of Helion, we hire engineers, scientists\nand technicians and machinists are hands-on\nbuilders. The company at Helion is very weird for a fusion company. Today,\nwe are 50% technicians, not scientists. - Nice. - And we have a ton of scientists, because\nthe science is critically important too, but they're supported by a\nhuge manufacturing company. And our goal is to build as fast as\npossible. Some of the other things we try to do there, vertically integrate.\nAnd this is to your point on Elon Musk, this is one of the things he's\nfocused on at his companies, has been how do you bring inside\nthe critical things that are going to drive timelines, the things\nyou can't just go buy as a commodity product and get it here soon, and make\nsure that you can go build those fast. And so we've done now a number\nof key vertical, integrated manufacturing lines at\nHelion. I think we may be the only fusion company with a conveyor\nbelt. Actually, our second one just came online now, where we\nliterally have our production line manufacturing power\nsupplies at Helion, so that we can move at maximum\nvelocity, rather than finding an external consultant or an\nexternal supplier to go do those. - Well, I love it. Builder-first\ncompany, and you're also thinking about manufacturing... ...throughout all of this. I'm looking\nat the photo of Trenta. It's beautiful. - And you can actually, I can point\nout on this picture one perfect example of what I'm talking\nabout. So on the end is a green structure, green\nfiberglass. This is called G10. Actually, ironically, one\nof the main structural elements we use is this G10 fiberglass material.\nIt's the same thing that's in PCB boards. It's the same substrate that's in every\ncircuit board. And so we know it's strong, it's good with\nelectricity, only we get big pieces of it and machine it. But even\nin the end, you can see the bolts halfway through. There's nine\nbolts in the middle there. The standard piece of G10 was not\nbig enough to fit the end of the machine, and so we could have\nhad one custom manufacturer manufacture a brand-new piece\nof a custom size, build a new mold and a new machine. It would have taken,\nI don't remember anymore now, but probably on the order of, usually these are\nabout six to 12 months. Or I could go to a supplier off the shelf,\nhave that delivered in a week, and now machine it with\nall the bolts in between. And then in-house, have\nthe G10 machine shop that can now machine the bolt holes, to\nactually bolt those pieces together. And so that's, that took extra engineering\nand having really clever and brilliant mechanical and structural engineers\nto figure out how to do that and still meet the needs of the fusion\nsystem. But that's what we tried. That's the kinds of teams we\ntry to build at Helion, is folks that want to really get their\nhands dirty, get hands-on, build things, move quickly.\nAnd everywhere you can, without sacrificing quality or\nsafety, take shortcuts. That's the name of the game. We've got to get\nfusion online as soon as possible. - Yeah, this is really exciting and really\ninspiring. So, I have to ask then, what timeline do you think, like first\nworking, out there, nuclear fusion power plant? When do you think? - Yeah, so what we've been able to do is build, rapidly build, every\nfew years, bring a new fusion system online. In 2023, we signed a deal with Microsoft to build a power\nplant for Microsoft, for one of their data centers. And this is a\npower plant that is plugged into the grid, generating electricity\nfrom fusion. And with a very, very tough\nambitious timeline of 2028 for the first electrons from that power plant. - And that power plant will\nbe powering a data center. - That power plant will be powering the grid\nthat the data center is plugged into. And we can get into the details\nof how the power grid works. But yes, so Microsoft will be buying\nthe power from that power plant. - Props to Microsoft for creating\na hard deadline. I love it. - They are. They are. And it is\ndaily that we think about that deadline. We had been working with them on and off through all of those\nmachines, through Grande, Venti, Trenta. So they had seen us build, hit milestones, show that we can do\nfusion, scale up by orders of magnitude, and then access these\nadvanced fusion fuels. So they had seen all of those things and seen\nthe manufacturing we built. We're already, right now,\nbuilding the manufacturing to support that power plant.\nWe're doing that today. We started two years ago\non doing the work around siting, around the interconnects.\nHow do you plug fusion in? What does it look like? How do you\nsite it? What are the environmental consequences? Who's gonna regulate it?\nAll of those things. So we spent a lot of time already and we're on our way, and\nit's gonna be hard. No joke about it. This is tough, and it's something\nthat I think about every day. - I'm sure you've had a bunch of people\nprobably still tell you that this is a pipe dream. Like, this is impossible.\nAre there days that you and the team think that this is indeed impossible?\nThen you wake up the next day and you're like, \"All right,\nwe're gonna do it anyway.\" - I mean, that's the thought process.\nThat's the mentality. We're gonna do it anyway, let's go do it. The world needs it.\nThere's no physics reason this can't be done. Now it's a question of how fast can\nyou build it? And can you engineer it to be as efficient as it\nneeds to be? And those are engineering and manufacturing are\nridiculously hard challenges. So do not short sell that. But that's the goal,\nand that's what we get up every day thinking about. This is something I was\nactually just thinking about and talking with some of my team in the last few days. We certainly have people that say,\n\"No, this can never be done.\" And we had that before.\nWe had that at the very beginning of, \"I want to\ngo merge these plasmas together,\" and folks said,\n\"Nope, that can never happen.\" And we went off and did it. And, \"You can't\ncompress an FRC because it's unstable.\" In fact, I actually still hear\nthat, \"FRCs are unstable.\" And I say, \"Yes, I know. Now let me\nintroduce you to S* over E, and 20 years of studies on what\nwe know about that and how we can combat that.\" And so we've been\nable to show, through lots of skepticism that we can still build and\niterate. And there are things I don't know. Let's just be totally honest. As we're\ngoing to go build these things, we're gonna new hard problems. If\nwe're not doing our job, if we're not discovering new hard problems,\nwe probably didn't push hard enough. We probably didn't push fast enough.\nAnd I think that's really critical. That we build the team\nand we do the hiring to make sure that everybody is doing\ntheir problem. Now that doesn't mean it's not a hard challenge, and to\nkeep folks motivated. Helion now is over 500 people. But when we\nbuilt Trenta, we were 50 people. - Okay. - So now there's, you know, over 300 humans\nworking at Helion that didn't see us build a system from a\ncomputer model, bring it online and do fusion with it. But even already for Polaris, there are\nlots of humans that started for our seventh generation system.\nWhen we were running Trenta, doing fusion, you know, they were able to see that,\nsee the measurements, know we were doing fusion. But yet, this next\nmachine was just a simulation. And so, seeing that get built,\nseeing that, like, it's just awe-inspiring for folks. And I'll tell\nyou, the first time that it comes online and flashes pink\nand you see that fusion glow, it's awe-inspiring.\nIt's awe-inspiring. - I love that. - I've... - The fusion glow, yeah. Yeah. - Everybody changes their Windows\ndesktop backgrounds to the fusion background, the plasma glow. - So how can you actually see it? - A couple of things. So one, to get\naccess to it, we have windows. We have small windows all the way\naround that we look into with cameras, spectroscopy, lasers, other kinds of\nscientific diagnostics that we use to measure. And so you see the\nlight emission through that. But also, it's very bright. And so, the actual vacuum vessels\nthemselves that we use are ceramic. There are some\nversions of silicon and oxygen, typically quartz, but\nthere's also some other sintered materials. And it's so bright\nthat they can shine through those materials, and so what you see\nis the light of not fusion. When fusion's happening, thermonuclear fusion\nis so hot that the light is in the X-ray spectrum, and the human\neye can't see that. But as your ice-cold, one million-degree\nplasma, when you're just getting started, it's emitting photons\nin a range and light in a range that humans can see. And so you see\nthat bright, purple, fuchsia color. - And this would be, if you're doing actual\ncameras, this would be like extremely high-speed cameras, that kind of thing? - We have high-speed ones and\nlow-speed ones. The traditional SLR cameras, which are the ones\nthat represent the right color, all they catch is the light, the\nintegrated light, the flash. They don't know, they can't\nsee the plasma forming, accelerating, compressing. They\ncan't see any of those things. They just see all of it integrated into\none bright flash. But the high-speed cameras, they can see that. And so the\nhigh-speed cameras we can use to actually measure that. In fact, we put special\nfilters on them to measure different wavelengths of light, so we can\ntell, is it the hydrogen? Is it the helium? Is it the helium-3? Who's\nemitting the light? When are they emitting? What particles\nare emitting the light and when? And so, by using those advanced diagnostics,\nwe can now take movies of that. Though it's not as great\nas just seeing that flash. - Yeah, I mean, it's beautiful, right, that human\nbeings are able to create something like that. It's truly beautiful. Just out\nof curiosity, are there some interesting intricacies connecting\nnuclear fusion power plant to the power grid? Like, are there\nsome constraints to the old-schoolness of the power grid in, let's say, in the\nUnited States? How do you get that- that Microsoft thing you mentioned,\nhow do you get from the nuclear fusion power plant to a\ncomputer with some GPUs? How do we make that connection?\nOr is that a trivial thing? - None of this is trivial. But there are, I think, simple\nways, and there are some really interesting engineering ways to do this.\nSo, just from the fundamental basics, as we're doing fusion, we push\nback on the magnetic field. We recharge these capacitors that\nstarted where the electricity started from. And that electricity\nthen sits on a capacitor at high voltage, DC voltage, that's steady.\nAt that point, it's reasonably easy to make 60 hertz power, make traditional\nAC power. It's the same way as you can take electricity in a battery and\nuse an inverter and just invert that to AC power. And large-scale grid\ninverters, we know how to do pretty well. One of the sort of\nunique things about a pulsed version of this, because it's\npulsed and a repetition rate between one and ten times a second, we\ncan adjust the power output. And so as the grid needs more power,\nwe can actually dial it up and down. And we've been able to demonstrate that\nwith our fusion systems. The smaller ones, the smaller plasma systems,\nwe've gone from zero, from off, to all the way to 100 times a second,\nand shown we can do 100 hertz operation. In fact, that system we ran\nfor over a billion operations, and just ran it steady all day long. - So each individual pulse is\nindependent in some sense. - Each individual pulse is different. Where\nyou put in your fuel, you do fusion, you exhaust it... - Cool - ...through those pumps from eBay, and then and then power output\nand electricity output. - Oh, wow. - But there's probably some more\nclever ways to do this, and when we founded Helion, the goal was\nto build low-cost baseload electricity. And what we started\nto see working with Microsoft, working with others now, that data\ncenters are going to be one of the biggest power needs in the\nfuture. We know that's coming up. And what's really unique is\nthat power in this form is direct recovery, not the steam turbine\npart, but direct electricity is already DC, which is steady, which is what computers really want anyway.\nSo are there really unique ways to take DC power sitting\non this capacitor, and rather than going AC to the grid and\nhaving all these transmission losses, just going direct DC to the\ndata center? Can you plug right in? And so that's some of the things\nthat my team is looking at now, is, can you do that direct\nDC conversion at super high efficiencies and run those\nGPUs directly? That would be really powerful if we could figure out how to do\nit. But those are some of the things that I think there might be some unique ways\nthat fusion and data centers can really couple together. There's\na whole cooling part to it too. Most of my cooling is cooling\nsemiconductors and cooling power switching, just like a data center. So\nthere's a lot of interesting engineering ways that we can\nbring those two together. - So a deeper integration between the power plant and the thing that\nit's powering. And it does seem like the future, quite possibly,\na lot of the energy that's needed will be for compute, for\nAI-related applications. So if you just look out into the\nfuture 10, 20, 50 years from now, do you see nuclear\nfusion as a thing that powers these gigantic data centers\nof millions of GPUs? Just basically, the surface of the Earth covered in compute and nuclear fusion\npower plants. Maybe that's 100 years out. - So when I talk to AI experts, they talk pretty routinely about\nthe power needs for AI. And in fact, in the same way\nin manufacturing that the cost of any one thing\nasymptotes to the raw material, for AI, the cost of computation\nasymptotes to the power to the cost of the electricity. And even\nmore, that electricity's concentrated. It's in that AI data center, that\nbrain where all the power is, where all the power is,\nand you really want a lot of high-energy density. You want\npower generation right there on site. So it seems like, take those two facts, a really nice match\nbetween fusion, which is base load, high energy density,\ncan be sited most places, and a data center, which is going\nto be high energy requirements in a local location, and\nlarge amounts of it. There's been predictions\nrecently from energy institutes that suggest we will have growth\nthat, rather than a 2% growth per year in electricity, may\nbe a 4 or a 6% growth in electricity due to data center\nuse. I think that is probably wildly underestimating\nwhere we're moving. And so, - Oh, man. - And so the idea that AI\ncan grow human cognition, and our ability to solve problems, we can't let it be limited by power.\nAnd so I'm going to push as hard as I can so that that's not the limit. - Do you ever think about, like,\n2050 or something like that? I know you're focused on a\nfew years out, just getting a fusion power plant working. But do you\never think about, like, even longer term future? By what year do you\nthink there'll be over 1000 nuclear fusion power plants? - So I tell the team that if we\ndemonstrate fusion one time, and that's it, then we failed. But that's not enough. The universe\nis powered by fusion. Humans need to be harnessing\nthis, and can harness this for our society, for the good\nof society, for the good of technology. And so that's\nsomething that we push towards. And in fact, it's baked\ninto how we design these machines. Coils are mass produced. Capacitors\nare mass produced, and we make them all. All across the board is thinking about not what the next system's\ngoing to be, but making sure we're building the manufacturing and the\ninfrastructure to build all those systems. So we had a call from the White House a number of years ago for\nthe Bold Decadal Study in Fusion of how do we get fusion? And it was\nHelion and a variety of other companies from the fusion industry. And it's pretty awesome to be able to say\nthere's a fusion industry now. It's not just a one-off thing, or there's a fusion\nexperiment, or somebody has a prototype. But like, there's an industry. That\nHelion has competitors. That's great. - I've never heard anyone so excited\nto have competitors. But yes, that's like a serious thing. That's\na real possibility. Yeah. - And the goal was how do we not just\ndemonstrate fusion in the next decade, but meaningfully\ndeploy it and start to answer... We have 4000 gigawatts\nof installed fossil fuel capacity. How do we start replacing that with\nfusion in a meaningful way? And how do we get to not just making a generator every few years? But we want a\nfactory, a Gigafactory of these fusion generators rolling off\nthe line, one a month, one a week, one a day? That's the kind of plans that I task my supply\nchain team with. Like, how do you do this? How do we actually\ngo build this? How do we go build a Gigafactory so we can have\n50-megawatt generators coming off the line, being deployed on a\ntruck, and then driving off the factory every day? And it's a tough\nchallenge. I see what others have been able to do in rockets, in electric\nvehicles, turning around huge factories. We know\nthis can be done, and so for fusion, the call is there, and\nthe market is there too. If you can get electricity generators cheap\nenough, then it's worth doing. - Yeah. All of this is really exciting\nand inspiring what you're doing. And obviously the world needs it, and the more cheap energy we have\nof this kind, that we described, clean, and it's\nnot constrained to geo- locations and so on, first\nof all, that alleviates a lot of the tension that in\ngeopolitics. But second of all, it enables a lot of the technological\nbreakthroughs on the AI side. on all the different things that we use\ncompute for. It's really, really exciting. So yeah, hope there's like millions\nof them in the coming decades. - And so if we can get to that, if we can get\nto making a generator a day, you're not now talking about hundreds a\nyear, and you're deploying them. And deploying them is\nalso hard at this scale. How do you go and deploy power plants and\ndeploy generators at this scale and do it quickly? Interestingly, data centers are\na little bit of a nicer challenge in that way, because I wouldn't, we wouldn't build one 50 megawatt system and have to\ngo build a site for it. We'd build a site and put 100 of them on that\nsite and have large amounts of power for that large data center. And so,\nso that in some ways is actually in the chicken and egg problem of how do you\ngo deploy hundreds or thousands of fusion generators. Data centers are an\ninteresting application where very immediately you need a lot\nof power in a very small area. And you can go, you can go do that. Now,\nwhat does that mean? That means I'm going to need more than two conveyor\nbelts, that's for sure. - Yeah. Yeah. Well, you have to... I\nmean, manufacturing is really hard. But like you said, the fascinating thing\nis it's hard but as you're doing it you figure out all the other things: the\nscience and the physics and everything. Everything... The innovation is\naccelerated when you have to manufacture at scale. It's actually\nfascinating to watch. You see that in the space industry as well. When do we humans get to Kardashev Type One\ncivilization status? And when do we get to a Kardashev Type Two? - So the Kardashev scale, Kardashev\nType One civilization is when humans are either catching or generating as much power\nas what's incident on the Earth from the sun. Type\nTwo is the next big one, where you're catching as much energy\nfrom all the way around the sun, so massive amounts of energy. And a lot\nof times, people talk about it as incident, as in you had solar panels\nthe size of the entire planet blocking all of the sun. But I think really,\nyou should be thinking about it as what can we generate? What can\nwe make here on Earth? And, What we know is that, you know,\nwe're only a fraction right now of Kardashev Type One, and\nwe got some work to do. And there's not a lot\nof technologies that can get there, just from the\npoint of view of the fuel. - Right. - But if, as some research\nsay, that there's 100 million to a billion years of fusion\nfuel on the Earth, we have room to go, and that's at today's use. So 100 times today's use, we\nstill have tons of fuel. Let's go do it. And what does that unlock?\nWhat does it unlock to have power 100 times the output that we\nactually do here on Earth right now? And I think that's pretty\ntransformational. Do we have those huge AI data centers? Do we have\nbrains that can now think at rapid speeds and now innovate? I think\nthat's a pretty powerful future. - Yeah, I can just imagine a\ngiant AI brain and rockets just constantly shipping more and more humans out into space, into\ncolonizing space, and we're expanding out into the universe. I\nmean, it's a obviously there's a lot to be concerned about.\nTechnology in itself is always a double-edged sword. There's always a concern that we humans,\nin the power we create, will also destroy ourselves in obvious ways and less than obvious ways. I've been spending a\nlot of time in nature. Of time in nature. And you become distinctly aware that there's something truly special\nabout the simplicity, the balance that is achieved by\nnature. And in some sense, we disturb that balance by creating\nsophisticated technologies. But in another sense, we're building something in the spirit of nature that's more and\nmore beautiful and allows us humans to flourish in a richer and richer\nway. So, a double-edged sword. - I think a lot about what does vast amounts\nof low-cost energy, low-cost electricity enable, and how does that work with nature?\nAnd if you have power, and this is why, one of the reasons we love fusion, is that's\nenergy-dense. So, a 50-megawatt facility we believe fits in a 27,000 square\nfoot building, on the order of an acre, for 50 megawatts.\nCompare that to solar would be 2,000 acres, at\nleast in Seattle. And what you can do there is transformational. And a lot of folks talk about\ndesalination and clean water so that we can be in places where\nthere's not a lot of water and those things. I actually think about\nfood, ironically, is that how much of the Earth's surface that used\nto be nature is now farmland? And we need it. We're going to grow\nfood because humans need to eat, and that's really critical,\nbut it's about 5 feet tall all over the Earth. Why can't you do\nit at 500 feet? Why can't you build a building where you're actually growing?\nIn the building, you're growing plants. I spend a lot of time thinking\nabout growing plants, ironically. At high densities, of food\ndensities, so that we can eat and we can exist and we can\ncoexist in a way that's energy-dense and rich. You\nmentioned actually going to space. You know, how do we go to\nspace now? We take methane fuels, or hydrogen fuels, and we\nburn them and we launch a rocket. There are all kinds of cool\nbeamed rocket technologies that I looked at early in my career, where\nyou can, like, beam microwaves, and so you have a microwave craft that\ndoesn't have to burn any fuel. And so if you have really dense, really good\npower on Earth, you can beam it to that microwave craft. It\ncan now use electricity as its rocket fuel. And so there are some\nreally powerful, interesting things you can do. Even deep space, it\ngets also more enabling, but even just launching from\nEarth. And so I think it opens up things we don't really even think\nabout, but it's just been theorized, \"Wow, if I had massive amounts\nof power in a small place that is low cost, this is what\nit could do.\" But I'm excited by what it can unlock that even we\ncan think about now, but even what we can't think about or we don't know yet. - Since you mentioned propulsion,\nis there some interesting use, possible use of nuclear\nfusion in propulsion, whether it's getting off of Earth or\nin going into deep space? - I mean, that's... Honestly, in a lot of\nways, that's how I got into fusion is thinking about that intersection\nof energy and space travel. And when you are in the solar system,\naround Earth's orbit, collecting the sun's energy makes a lot of sense. And it's\nthere. It's free. When you're in space, you get a lot more of it because the\natmosphere is not blocking it. And so that's why spacecraft run on solar panels. But if\nyou want to go further out, the sun's irradiance falls off as R-squared,\nradius squared. And it's a long way out there. It doesn't take\nvery long before there's not a lot of energy anywhere from the sun.\nAnd so you have to bring it with you, and in space, mass is expensive.\nMass is hard. That's the rocket equation. And so being able to bring\nhigh energy density fuel is really exciting, and that's what fusion enables. But here's one of\nthe challenges. If you make electricity from fusion\nusing a steam cycle, you now need to have\nsomewhere. You need something cool, so you get hot water, you now\nhave to be able to cool it. And in space, there's nothing to cool.\nThere's no working fluid to cool off of. And so actually, a lot\nof the steam-based systems in fusion don't make sense for space.\nAnd so that's where some of this direct energy, this energy\nefficiency matters. It actually comes to some of the origin story\nof the team that founded Helion. Before spinning off\nHelion to focus only on fusion, we worked on a mix of things:\nadvanced materials, rocket propulsion, fusion, fusion rockets, fusion\nmaterials, all of those things. - Nice. - And one thing that people\nin the aerospace field especially if you're in deep space,\nis you can't waste anything. Every watt of electricity you make, you better\nuse, 'cause it was expensive to get it, or the solar panel. Every ounce of every\njoule of heat, every watt of heat you make, every ounce of every joule of\nheat, every watt of heat you make, you have to reject with a radiator,\nand it's super expensive and heavy. And so you build in space as efficient as\npossible. You recirculate your water and your air, You recirculate your water, and your air, and all of those things, you're efficient. And\nit's something we brought into thinking about thinking about fusion energy efficiency. is that you want to... If my goal is to make the\nproduct, what's the product? The product is electricity. The product is electricity. Don't waste any of it.\nRecover every watt you can by recovering electricity Recover every watt you can by\nrecovering electricity directly. Recover every electricity from the fusion\nprocess as efficiently as you can. and you end up with, just like in space, systems\nthat are smaller, have higher performance, smaller, have higher performance, and can\ndeliver more, whatever the mission is. And in our case, the\nmission is electricity. - When you look out there at the stars, I'm really confused by what's going on,\nbecause I think there is for sure thousands, if not millions, of\nadvanced alien civilizations out there. I'm really confused why we\nhave not, in a definitive way, met any of them. So again, continuing\nthe pothead questions, what energy source do you think they're using? If what I'm\nsaying is true, that there is alien civilizations out there, do you think it's,\nlike, pretty certain that they, in order to expand out into the cosmos,\nthey would be using nuclear fusion? - It's hard to imagine anything else.\nThat right now, what ... where does energy in the universe come from? And it\ncomes from fusion. It comes from stars and- and we- we know that that's\nthe process. And so whether they're harnessing the star itself,\nKardashev type two, or are they bringing fusion along 'cause they\nwant to go somewhere and they're bringing it with them to go visit. I think\nthat that's pretty likely. That's pretty likely. You bring up the Fermi\nparadox. How come we don't see alien civilizations? How come we don't see alien civilizations?\nEven if it's an infinitesimally small chance if it's an infinitesimally small chance\nthat there is life on any one planet, and infinitesimally small that\nlife grows into intelligent life, there are, however, almost infinite planets\naround infinite stars in our galaxy infinite planets around infinite stars in our\ngalaxy that have been around for vastly longer that have been around for vastly longer than\nwe've been around. But we don't see it, But we don't see it, and I think that's a question\nthat many scientists and everyone has wrestled with that many scientists and everyone\nhas wrestled with over the years. - I mean, I'm very scared by\nthe implications of that. The scary thing is that, to the\npoint that we made earlier, as we become more and more\ntechnologically advanced, we end up destroying ourselves. Like,\nthere could be things we unlock, like nuclear weapons, but plus plus. Like, new things that happen as you develop super\nadvanced systems that close to 100% probability that close to 100% probability destroy\nourselves, destroy any intelligent being. destroy ourselves, destroy any intelligent being. The\nkind of intelligent being that's ambitious enough The kind of intelligent being that's ambitious enough\nto keep innovating will eventually destroy itself, will eventually destroy itself, will\nbe one explanation. And that's scary. That should be a sobering thought. That's at least\nan inspiring, sobering thought to be careful an inspiring, sobering thought, to\nbe careful with the stuff we create. create. But I also just look at\nhumans. We create dangerous stuff- and then figure out, sometimes almost last\nminute, how to not destroy ourselves. minute, how to not destroy ourselves.\nWe're good with deadlines. - We're good with deadlines. Ah, we- - And we're good at, like, surviving.\nI mean, life as we know it on Earth seems to find a way, and intelligent life as we know it, human life, seems to\nfind a way. We do a lot of painful things along the way, but in the end, we somehow survive. It's interesting.\nThere's something in the human spirit- that allows us to survive. So I\nhave a lot of optimism about the super powerful technologies that we\ncreate will eventually lead to us still surviving for thousands of\nyears. But then, like, why are the aliens not here, though? So maybe it's also possible that\nit's really difficult to traverse space. Maybe it really is that\ndifficult. The physics makes it not easy. There's a lot of space, and\nit's just hard to- hard to travel. - I think I, as I have gone further and\nfurther in building fusion systems that work I've become more optimistic around\nthe Fermi Paradox specifically. And there's- there is the, uh ... There's\nseveral of them. The ... I think you're referring to something called the\ngreat filter. S- something happens that filters out life. The\ndark forest is another philosophy around, sure, it's out there,\nbut everybody's hiding 'cause they won't- don't want to be noticed. But I think about\nsomething else, actually. The philosophy that I've always loved, and I'm going to pronounce this\nwrong, so I apologize, Matrioshka brains. ... is that ... And that's Kardashev\nlevel two, that civilizations get so advanced, and they\nfocus not on expanding physically, and expanding\nin space, and expanding their reach by planting\nflags in new places, but grow their cognition,\ngrow their ability to think. They grow their brain.\nThey grow their intellect. And I- I feel like in the last few\nyears, we've seen a massive trend that maybe this is\nthe thing that happens, and that we do grow our intellect, and we\ngrow the- the intellect of the species by AI and advanced tools. And- and as a\nsociety can just get smart enough that we don't need to go plant those flags\neverywhere. And so the Matrioshka brain is a Dyson sphere where a civilization has covered the entire sun\nin essentially solar panels or collects its light in some way\nand uses all of that power to power intelligence, to power\ncomputers and to power brains. And I think we're a way\nfrom that, a ways away from that, but maybe AI and fusion\ntogether gets you actually along that path sooner. And\nI'm- I'm excited by that outcome of the Fermi paradox.\nAnd then at that point, those civilizations have a- a star that you\ncan't find anymore 'cause it's all covered and are there\nthinking and growing their intellects rather than actually\nhaving to physically expand. - Yeah. Exploring and\nexpanding in the realm of cognition and consciousness\nversus in the realm of space and time as we- we 21st\ncentury colonizer humans Think like. Maybe 22nd\ncentury humans will be thinking fundamentally differently.\nYeah, that's a beautiful, beautiful vision of the future.\nSpeaking of beauty, you've been doing a lot of really interesting\nthings in a lot of interesting disciplines. What to you is... ridiculous question, is the most\nbeautiful idea in physics and nuclear engineering, in nuclear\nfusion and power plants? What ideas you just step back are and are in awe of? - I'm continuously in awe that it works. And I know that sounds\na little silly to say. But the more that I learned in my career\naround the balance of exactly the right temperatures where life works, exactly the right balance between the electromagnetic\nforce and the strong force. Those are things that it's hard\nto imagine are accidental. And so we talk about how beautiful\nnature is, but then you look at what each of the leaves on the\ntree really is, and each of the cells and each of the atoms and each\nof the quantum substructure of that atom, and I'm just amazed that\nall the pieces come together. - we humans are somehow able to find that\nperfect balance where it just works. - Just works. Last minute\nsometimes, but it does work. - The kind of deadlines\nyou're operating, your the group of brilliant people that you're\nworking with or operating under, it just stresses me out, but it excites me. So I'm\ndeeply grateful that you're doing this work. You're one of the people\nbuilding an exciting future. So thank you for doing that, and\nthank you so much for talking today. - Thank you very much. It's been fun. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with David\nKirtley.

Kennedy. \"We choose to do these things, not because they are easy,\nbut because they are hard.\" Thank you for listening,\nand hope to see you next time.",
