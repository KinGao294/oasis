So it's not the drugs, actually, that idea to go through the\nArdennes Mountains. If you, if you think monocausal, you would say that's\nthe reason. That idea was genius, and Hitler immediately\nunderstood it, because before, the plan was to attack in the north of\nBelgium, which is the same as World War I. It becomes a stalemate, and\nthey fight for months, and no one really moves, and it's bloody,\nand nothing's happening. It's bad. But that was the only plan\nthat they had. That's why the high command said, \"No, we're not going to do it.\nIt's stupid.\" But these three tank generals, they said, \"Look, if we go with the\nwhole army through the Ardennes Mountains,\" and like Hitler, \"Eh, this is\nnot possible. This is like a mountain range. How can the whole German\narmy fit through this eye of a needle,\" basically. And\nthey said, \"No, we can do it because everyone misunderstands what\ntanks can do. Tanks are not slow machines in the\nback that wait for the action to happen, and then support this\nsomehow. We're going to use tanks in the front as race cars,\nbasically. We're going to overpower the enemy. We're\ngoing to be in France before they know it. We are already\nbehind them, but it would only work if you would reach Sedan, the\nborder city of France, within three days and three nights, and that was\nonly possible if you don't stop.\" Suddenly, Ranke realized that\nhis moment had come because he had the recipe how people could stay\nawake for three days and three nights. Before that, he was kind of an outsider, like the\nfreak with the drug idea. Suddenly, he became ...like- ...\"Okay, tell us, how does it\nwork?\" And he gave lectures in front of the officers, and he wrote a\nstimulant decree where a whole army is prescribed a drug, in this\ncase methamphetamine, how much should be taken, and at what intervals.\nThis became a very big thing. And then Temmler had to\ndeliver 35 million dosages to the front lines. And then\non May 10th, they took their methamphetamine and they started the surprise\nattack through the Ardennes Mountains. - The following is a conversation\nwith Norman Ohler, author of Blitzed: Drugs in the Third Reich. A book that investigates what role\npsychoactive drugs, particularly stimulants such as methamphetamine,\nplayed in the military history of World War II. It\nis a book that two legendary historians, Ian Kershaw and\nAntony Beevor, give very high praise to. Ian Kershaw\ndescribes it as, \"Very well researched, serious piece of\nscholarship.\" And Antony Beevor describes it as, \"Remarkable\nwork of research.\" And it is indeed a remarkable\nwork of research. Norman went deep into the archives using\nprimary sources to uncover a perspective on Hitler and the Third\nReich that has before this been mostly ignored by\nhistorians. He also wrote Tripped: Nazi Germany, the CIA,\nand the Dawn of the Psychedelic Age. And he's now working\non a new book with the possible title of Stoned Sapiens, great title, looking at the history\nof human civilization through the lens of drugs. This is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it,\nplease check out our sponsors in the description and consider\nsubscribing to this channel. And now, dear\nfriends, here's Norman Ohler. Tell me the origin story of meth, methamphetamine, and Pervitin,\nits brand name drug version, in the context of Nazi Germany in the\nlate 1930s. Let's start there. - I think you're right to ask about\nthe context because without the context, it's not really\nunderstandable. So what was the situation? In the 20s, the Nazi movement\nbasically started, and it started in Bavarian beer halls. So\nalcohol was the drug of choice of the early Nazi movement.\nThe only guy that didn't drink was Hitler. He was\na teetotaler, I guess you say. So that was happening\nin Munich. So alcohol and National Socialism are very\nclosely connected. At the same time, in the 20s, in Berlin, there was\na completely different thing going on. People were taking all\nkinds of drugs. This had to do, actually, with the defeat of Germany\nin the First World War. I mean, the context is a big context. The Versailles Treaty\nhad the effect that the German economy was not really able to recover\nafter the end of World War I. The Versailles Treaty was\nwritten basically by the Western victorious powers. Germany had no\nsay in the negotiations. And I'm certainly not a German\nnationalist, not even a German patriot, but even I would say\nthat the Versailles Treaty treated Germany somewhat unfairly. I mean,\nit laid all the blame on Germany. And, I mean, a war is a very complex\nthing, and the First World War to examine how it actually started\nis a very complex, you know, story, and there's many factors to it. But\nthe Versailles Treaty just said it was Germany's fault, and then\nGermany had to do all these payments to the allies. It\ncouldn't create a new economy. It couldn't have a new army. So it was — the\neconomy really went down. Everything in Berlin was cheap, and the people were also using substances that were very cheap\nin huge quantities. So while in Bavaria, they were drinking\nalcohol, and alcohol in the brain, stimulates behavior, group behavior: us against them. You can actually\nexamine this. A neuroscientist would know exactly how this works. While\nin Berlin, the drugs that were used were morphine. There\nwas cocaine, there was mescaline, there was ether.\nSo people were experimenting. Everyone developed a different mindset.\nIt was all... you know, you didn't behave in a way that some kind of authority would like you\nto behave in, because the authority had just lost the First World War\nand there was no real authority in Berlin. People were doing whatever they\nwanted to do, and they were intoxicating themselves in the way they wanted to do\nit. So the population, in a way, if you just look at Munich and Berlin,\nwas growing apart. Like, there were the alcohol people in Munich,\nthe Nazis, and then there were these weird, diverse, LGBTQ, whatever\nkind of scene in Berlin. Like, actresses sniffing ether in the\nmorning and then making crazy moves. - Could you speak to the nature of the\nmotivation of the drug use in Berlin at the time? Was it rebellion? Was\nit a way to deal with the difficult economic depression? Was it just\nthe natural thing that young people do to explore themselves, to understand the world,\nto develop their culture? Like, what do we understand about drug use there? - All of these factors come together. But\nit was the first time in modern history, in Germany at least, that there\nwas no emperor. Like, before that, Kaiser Wilhelm, everything\nwas very strict, you know? You had to... you couldn't go crazy, you\nknow, as a young person. You couldn't be a young person. But now in the\nWeimar Republic in the '20s, you could. No one stopped you, so people\nwent crazy. That's what made Berlin into the city that it\nstill somehow is. And maybe later we talk about contemporary\nBerlin. It kind of... it's still has that vibe, you know? That's why\npeople still come to Berlin. Drugs are cheap, you can move however you want,\nthere's no authority. So that created a rift between the Nazis in Munich,\nand they always hated Berlin and what was going on in Berlin. So,\nfor example, Goebbels, the later propaganda minister, he called\nthe situation in Berlin the hated asphalt reality of Berlin. He hated that. And when the Nazis\nthen were able to take power in 1933, one of the first things they did was to really prosecute\npeople who were taking drugs, because they wanted to, you know,\nbring everyone back into the fold. And I think that's... You asked what\nwas the reason for people taking so many drugs. They were\naccessible, they were cheap, but I think the most\nimportant thing is that they let you find yourself maybe, or lose yourself, you know? Also\npossible, you know? - Can we also talk about that here, because you have a connection to\nthis place, Berlin, and this part of the world. Can you\njust briefly speak to that so we can contextualize even\ndeeper the personal aspect of this? Because you understand\nthe music of the people, the land, its history. There's\nsomething you can only really understand if you've been\nthere and you have taken it in. And we'll return to this topic\nin multiple contexts, but in this particular way, as one human being\nwho writes about this place, what's your own story? - I grew up in West Germany, and\nthis was during the World War. And Berlin, the walled-in city,\nwas always like a big fascination. There was a wall, there\nwas actually a wall in the city preventing people to move into\nanother part. And I was from the West, fortunate enough to be\nfrom the free West, so I could travel to Berlin and I could leave. I could look\nat it, and I always loved Berlin. I thought it was a very vibey place. And then\nwhen the wall came down, I was still in school but I immediately got into\nthe car of my parents and drove there. I wanted to see how it came down.\nAnd then Berlin really, in the '90s, became a place that was\nvery attractive to me and I moved there then in the '90s. I was first\nliving in New York. I wrote my first novel in New York, and I loved\nNew York before Giuliani became mayor. It was... He ruined\nthe city. Before that, it was not gentrified. Or let's say\nhe introduced gentrification, and gentrification is a big\ntopic. I still lived in the ungentrified New York City for\nlike 300 bucks a month rent, and everyone I knew was an artist. - You loved the diversity of it? - Yeah, I loved it. I wrote my\nfirst novel there. I took LSD for the first time in Downtown\nManhattan on a Saturday night. - So you're kind of like a German\nKerouac type character, but moved a few decades forward. - I wouldn't compare myself to another\nwriter, but I think Kerouac is pretty cool. But he's an amphetamine writer.\n\"On the Road\" was apparently written in two weeks on amphetamines.\nAnd, but it's good. Amphetamines are not bad per se. We can also talk\nabout these so-called bad drugs, you know, because basically they're\nneutral. But let's not lose the thread. - Yes. Yes. New York, Berlin- - Even though New York was- - Yes. - Oh, yeah. And then I was in New York. I was\nin a health food store, one of the first. Like, there weren't health food stores\nback then a lot, but there was one on First Avenue. And suddenly\nthere was an announcement, which was unusual in the health food\nstore. I think it was called Prana, Prana Foods. And the announcement was that\nKurt Cobain had just shot himself. It was like... and I had been\nactually, and still am, a Nirvana fan. I've seen one of\nthe last concerts of Nirvana in New York City, and it was\namazing. But he killed himself. And the next day, I received a\nmusic cassette from a friend of mine from Berlin with electronic\nmusic, and I realized that there had been a paradigm shift,\nobviously. Rock music with the hero on stage was dead. Now it\nwas, you know, dance, electronic music, which a lot of people\ntoday think it's kind of simplistic music form, but it's actually a very highly\nintelligent music form. At least it was in the '90s. People were really experimenting\nwith that music. That was the new music. That was actually the reason I moved\nto Berlin. I really decided I'd leave New York City. I'm going to\nmove to Berlin. And then in Berlin, to answer your question, I fell in love with something\nthat probably reminded me of the '20s, even though I\nwasn't there in the '20s. That really... The city was very open. The\nwall had just... was still, you know... I mean, it's a few years later, but still,\nthe wall, it felt like it just came down. There was... Germany was... Berlin was not\nyet the capital of Germany. That was still in Bonn. So Berlin was a very cheap, and cultural, and crazy city,\nprobably a bit like in the '20s, actually. And that's how I fell in love with it, and that's\nhow I became interested in this electronic scene. I mean, I visited many dance\nvenues then, so-called clubs. - Yeah, it's one of the hubs in\nthe world of electronic music. - They claim that techno was kind of\ninvented in Berlin, but it also comes from Detroit. So Detroit and Berlin\nare like the techno hubs, I would say. - Yeah, electronic music is a soundtrack\nfor some of the most interesting experiences this earth has ever\ncreated, right? Just it gets people together in some interesting ways.\nSo it's not just the music itself, it's the experiences\nthat the music enables. - Well, in Germany, we had a situation\nthat the wall actually kept people apart. People didn't know each other.\nBut because the wall came down, people suddenly met in abandoned buildings\nin the center of Berlin, which had been owned by the socialist state\nof East Germany. The most famous club, Tresor... Tresor means, like, vault. It was the big vault with\nthe big doors, so that's where Tresor was, the club. - It's so funny that the echo 100\nyears later, Berlin had all these left-wing partiers, young people\nusing drugs, and then Munich with the beer, and then that's where Hitler came\nout. So is that what we're supposed to imagine in the early days of the\nNazi party when Hitler's giving the speeches to just a handful\nof folks, they're all drunk? - Well, it is a fact that the movement came out of the\nBürgerbräukeller. It's a certain restaurant pub in Munich,\nand that was not only a beer hall, that was also a\npolitical venue. And it was a right-wing venue. It was for\nright-wing populists. People like communists wouldn't use it, even though communists\nare in many ways quite similar to the right wing, especially back then. But\nit was used by right-wingers, and Hitler didn't mind because\npeople who are drunk are more susceptible to right-wing\npopulism, I would claim now here, and Hitler would agree. So he did not think\nit was bad that these people were a bit drunk, or maybe even very drunk, because\nif you're drunk you also get aggressive against others. He could\nplay with that, you know? - So drunk, aggressive towards\nothers, but drunk in a group. - It constitutes the group also... ...if everyone is on the same alcohol\nlevel. You can just go to Oktoberfest in Munich, which is not a political\nthing, but everyone, you know, you can kind of sense how it\noriginated. And actually, the first time the Nazis tried to grab power was the so-called Beer Hall\nPutsch. I mean, that's a historical event. It took place in 1923, and it was after a drunk night where they suddenly\ndecided, \"Now we're going to do it.\" So they came out of\nthe Bürgerbräukeller, and they were all drunk except\nHitler, and they just tried to overtake the Munich government, and\nthey miserably failed because it was just a stupid drunk idea. They were\nlike, \"Yeah, let's just do it.\" And the Bavaria police, quite sober\nthat day, they just, you know, shot them to the ground. Hitler\nwas almost killed. He just jumped behind his bodyguard. Göring,\nduring the Beer Hall Putsch was wounded in his stomach\nwith a, I think, a gunshot. That's why he became a\nmorphine addict. So this Beer Hall Putsch in '23 had severe effects.\nAlso, they were sentenced to prison, and Hitler wrote Mein Kampf in prison. - All these little events come\ntogether. It's so interesting that for them it was just life, but now we look back at these\ncritical moments in history that turned the tides of human\ncivilization, right? So Hitler could have died there, and these characters,\nGöring, that became larger than life— that influenced the lives and\nthe deaths and the suffering of millions, all... First of all,\nit could have been stopped then, and whatever that means when you look back at history. But\nall those are just human beings developing their ideas, growing,\ndeveloping groups, developing ideologies, and using drugs or drinking. - I mean, that's why I thought it's\ninteresting, for example, to examine Hitler's drug use. When I announced that to a historian\nwhile I was doing research, he helped me a lot with\nmethamphetamine and the army, a proper medicine historian from the\nUniversity of Ulm. And then I said, \"Now I'm interested in Hitler.\" He said,\n\"No, don't. This is not interesting. This is not serious... His, his...\n\"This is not serious history.\" But it's... You know, even Hitler\nwas a person, you know? And if you understand, for example, the substance\nabuse of a person, of course you understand more about that person.\nAnd historians never had that idea before. Kershaw, for example,\nwho is really a great... He's very knowledgeable about National\nSocialism. Like many British historians, they always know more\nabout German history than the German historians, but Kershaw really\ndoes. I think he's, he's really good. But in his biography of Hitler,\nhe just writes one sentence like, \"And then he had a crazy doctor\ncalled Morell who gave him dubious medications and drugs,\" and he\nstops there, and then he goes on to describe whatever. - Yeah, we should say that Ian Kershaw is widely considered to be probably one\nof the greatest biographers of Hitler. - I think he wrote the best\nbiography of Hitler. - Which is so important. Your work is\nreally important because it opens a whole new perspective on the lives of\nthe individuals and the machinery of the Nazi military that historians\nhaven't looked at. It's so interesting that you can unlock\nthose perspectives. And that's the underlying really, the foundation\nof our conversation today and of your work, is there are layers\nto this thing. You can look at the tactics of war and the strategic level of war, the operational\nlevel of war. You could look at the human suffering of war, the love stories.\nYou could look at the hate, the psychology of propaganda, or you\ncould look at the individual things, substances consumed by\nthe individuals that make up the Nazi Party leadership and\nthe soldiers. And all those are critically important to understand\nthe war, right? And this piece of drug use and supplement use\nhave been ignored by historians. - That was very surprising to me, you\nknow. I didn't know this myself. I never planned to write this book.\nIt kind of happened to me. And I decided to team up with the\nleading German historian on National Socialism, Hans Mommsen, who has passed away by now. He was\nquite old, but quite ready to be my mentor for this\nbook, \"Blitzed.\" And he was maybe even shocked when I\ncame back from the military archive of Germany with a lot\nof copies, all relating to the systematic drug use of\nthe German army, including an experiment done by the\nNavy, who had always pretended to be the clean, in German we\nsay Waffengattung, weapon. Like you have the Army, you have\nthe Air Force, you have the Navy, you have... And in Germany they had the\nSS. And the Navy always pretended to be like, \"We weren't really\nNazis. We were like,\" you know, the German Navy.\nWe had our ethics code.\" But I found in the archive that the Navy did human experiments in\nthe concentration camp of Sachsenhausen, trying to find\na new wonder drug, because they had new, what they called \"wonder weapons\"\nor what Hitler called \"wonder weapons.\" He always talked about these wonder weapons.\nWonder weapons were basically mini submarines. One or two people would go in, staying\nunderwater for up to a week and torpedoing, you know, Allied ships. So the Navy was trying to develop\na drug that would keep you awake and combat-ready\nfor seven days and seven nights without sleep and\nwithout, you know, burning out. Very difficult to find. So they hired a penalty unit in the concentration\ncamp. They hired... The SS had a so-called \"shoe-walking\nunit.\" It was a penalty unit within the concentration\ncamp, testing shoe soles for the German shoe industry, walking\nfor days. And then they would measure how the soles,\nyou know, kept up in the stress. And they had\ndifferent layers in the concentration camp, like\nall the surfaces the German soldiers would touch when they\nconquered Europe. So this is a very elaborate thing. If you go to\nthe concentration camp today, it's a museum. You can still see that\nrunning track of the shoe runners unit. So the Navy hired the\nshoe runners unit from the SS, paid them money, and then\ngave them different kinds of drug combinations, methamphetamine\ncombined with cocaine and, you know, chewing gum and\nall kinds of things. So this is a big thing. And there's documents to it. And Mommsen, who knew\neverything about National Socialism, the old, you know, authority. And I'm like the young... I didn't study\nhistory. I just, you know, I just try to make sense, you know. But I\npresent him all these documents. He's reading like from this\nPill Patrol and he said, \"Wow.\" He said, \"We historians, we never\ndo drugs. We don't understand drugs. This, we missed\nthis.\" So he was very clear that we missed this. And he said\nthis is actually the missing link that historians did not have, especially\nto explain Hitler's degeneration as a leader. He made very good decisions,\ngood in meaning militarily effective decisions in the beginning of\nthe war, and very bad decisions for the German war effort towards\nthe end. And you can link that to drugs. You can explain a lot\nof Hitler through the drugs, but you can also look at this point that\nhistorians so far had not been able to figure out basically. What happened\nto Hitler? Why did he get crazy? He was crazy, but why\ndid he get so bad as a leader? Because he was very\neffective for a long time, and then there's this moment where it turns. - Yeah, the degeneration of decision-making. Psychology, behavior, all of\nthat. You cannot understand that fully without understanding\nhis drug use. And we should also say that some of the historians you\nmentioned, Ian Kershaw and Anthony Beevor, these legends of history, they\nall gave you compliments. So, Kershaw said that, \"Your work is very\ngood, extremely interesting, and a serious piece of well-researched history.\"\nAnthony Beevor said that it's a remarkable work of research.\nSo, props to them. You have received a bunch of criticism\nfrom historians, but you've also received, obviously, a lot\nof props. I mean, Kershaw's, the legendary historian of Hitler,\ncomplimenting how deep your work is. That must feel good. Maybe this is a good moment to also,\nsince we're talking about historians, to address some of the criticism. So, Richard\nEvans was also a great historian, has been one of the bigger critics. He said\nthat your work is crass and dangerously inaccurate, and is morally and politically dangerous. I think that's\ngrounded in the idea that if you say that, \"Well,\nall the Nazi forces and Hitler were on drugs, so therefore\ntheir evil can be... They're not really evil. It's just accountability can be\nremoved because they were using drugs.\" - Right. - And also another criticism\nof his, which I also understand and probably can steelman, is if you look too much through the\nsingular lens of drugs, you can overemphasize it. You know,\nyou can overemphasize how important it was as an explainer of the\neffectiveness of Blitzkrieg, for example. Because there is some... I\nmean, I should say there is something really compelling about\na singular theory that explains everything, and you can fall\nin love with it too much as an explainer. So, can you\nsteelman his criticism or a criticism you received,\nand also argue against it? - I think he's absolutely right that\nyou shouldn't argue in a monacausal way. And this is actually\nwhat Mommsen also said to me, because, of course, I was\nenthusiastic about all my drug findings. And he said, \"Don't argue in\na monacausal way, especially the war.\" - There's a lot of variables, a lot of\nfactors, a lot of things going on. - Yeah. So that sentence of his, \"Don't argue in a\nmonacausal way,\" that always stayed with me. And I think that, I\ndidn't deviate from that path actually. But it was still\ninteresting that Evans thought that I put too much emphasis on\nthe drugs. I think it's a totally fine, you know, opinion. I would\ndisagree. Otherwise, I wouldn't have written the book. What I can state here is that I invented nothing. In all of\nmy three non-fiction books, nothing is invented. If you\nare a good writer, and I trained as a novelist, for me, it was also\nvery unusual to write a non-fiction book. I wanted to write a novel about Nazis\nand drugs. My publisher said, \"No, this is...\" And he looked at the, you\nknow, at the facts. He said, \"Someone has to write the facts.\" So I\nsaid, \"But non-fiction books are boring.\" He said, \"Not necessarily.\nMaybe you can find a way to write it with your novelistic style, but based 100%\non the facts.\" And that is like... In German we say \"Spagat.\" How do you\nsay that? A split, like when you do with your legs, like...\nIt's hard, you know? Because with a very fluent, sophisticated language, you can easily\noverpower the reader. If I describe how the German\nguys, 19-year-old guys took the meth and went into\nthe tank, and the meth started kicking in, five guys on meth\nafter like one hour of ride into France, you can write that in a powerful way\nthat if you are the reader, you would think, \"Yeah. I mean, the Blitzkrieg\nwithout meth is unthinkable.\" - There is a bit of a... Man, I\nwish I found that kind of feeling for historians, right? Like,\n\"How did I miss this piece?\" So some historians, like\ngreat historians like Kershaw, obviously, see,\nthey kind of give you a, like a slow clap, applaud. And\nsome historians are a little bit skeptical, like, \"This is a little too\ngood.\" So totally understandable. And... - Also, they have different techniques to write texts like this. I\nused a totally different technique. And I have an apparatus, so it\nreally feels like it could be an academic work. But still,\nit's written in a way that it kind of overpowers.\nIt, it kind of colonializes the story in a weird way. I never\nthought about it like that. But while I was writing it, I was just trying\nto write it as well as I could. I didn't think about these questions\nwe're talking about now. I just... I got carried away, obviously,\nbut I never left the area of facts. - Yes. So we should talk about your process.\nThat's also super fascinating. You went to the archives. You went to the sources.\nWhat's that take? What does it feel? What does it smell like? What\ndoes it look like? What does it entail? How much text is there? What\nlanguage is it in? What's the process there? - I never thought of going to the archives. And my\ngirlfriend at the time, she said, \"You have to go to the archives.\" And she's an academic. So\nshe... And I was like, \"Yeah, okay. I'll go.\" \"I'm fine. I'll check it out.\" And\nthen when I met a historian, he claims that without methamphetamine, there would be no\nBlitzkrieg, no victory of Germany. Like he's mono-causal. But he was also extremely\nhelpful to me, and he's an academic. He, he, he gave me the\nsignatures, it's called in German, where you find stuff in the archives.\nSignature is like... Then it says like H2/538, something like this. And\nthese were the files of Professor Ranke. And Professor Ranke\nwas... He was the head of the Institute for Army Physiology. His job was\nto improve the performance of the soldier. of the soldier. And all of his stuff was filed in a certain place in the\nmilitary archives, which in Germany is in Freiburg, in the south, in a small\ntown, not in Berlin. Because Germany is a bit of a decentralized country. We\ndon't want to put everything into Berlin again like the Nazis\ndid. We try to avoid our mistakes. So the military archive\nis in Freiburg, and I went there. And because I had this signature, immediately I got original\ndocuments that were all relating to my research.\nI had the original. - What does it look like?\nIs it sheets of paper? - Yeah, it's like- - Like, it's not scanned, it's- - Well, it's different things. The\nguy who did the meth into the army, Professor Ranke. He was\nwriting a war diary. That's what the name was, War Diaries. So every\nday he would write it by hand. So this war diary was given to me. - So you're reading that? So it's\nlike dated? You have a date- - Yeah - ... the diary? - It was a bit funny with him because he took a lot of meth himself\nbecause he thought it was great. He just thought it\nincreases your performance. By now, we know a little bit more that\nmethamphetamine is not so healthy. Because you get used to it and you burn\nout, you get depressed, then you take more. Big problem. And he became depressed and\nburnt out, and he didn't realize it's because of the meth that he's\ndescribing to the whole German army. He made a convincing\ncase. I can explain that in detail how that actually happened. But just\nto have his war diary was great, and then he would also type letters writing to the Company of Temmler, how fast\nthey could produce stuff in which time. So you have all these\noriginal documents. You have like 500 documents and he writes\nreports, like, what happened in this battle on methamphetamine.\nThere's a lot of stuff you can find in the archives if you find them.\nBut, the tricky thing is that you can only look. You kind of\nlook at a so-called find book. In the find book you cannot type in \"drugs.\" It wouldn't find anything\nbecause at the time when they were taking all the notes from\nthis doctor, his war diary, everything, they didn't put the label\n\"drugs\" there. They put the label his name, his position, World War II, French campaign, stuff like that.\nBecause at the time they didn't know that I would at one point come\nand look for drugs in that. But he was the drug guy, but also they\ndidn't realize he was the drug guy. No one realized that he was the drug\nguy. So it's not easy to find stuff in the archives. The archives you go to,\nit's a very Kafkaesque experience. You go into this building, and you have\nto understand the rules and you will never fully understand what's going on.\nAlso, the archivists, they don't really know what's going on because there are so many\ndocuments. No one's read them all, you know? No one knows. History is just kind of lying\nthere, somehow organized, somehow stored. - I mean, it does sound\nlike a very Kafkaesque- - It's- - ... thing. - But it's great if you find something,\nbut you can also sit there for a week and not find anything. - So what was the process for\nyou? You're just reading, open-minded, trying to see if there's\nsome truth here to be discovered? - Well, I have a friend. He's a\nDJ, and we talked about Berlin. We'll probably talk about it more, and\nhe takes a lot of drugs and he knows his Let's put it that way, he knows his drugs. And one day he said to me when I was\ntrying to figure out what I would write about next, he said, \"The Nazis took a lot of drugs.\nYou should write about that.\" And I said, \"The Nazis didn't take drugs,\" because, you know,\nwhen you grow up in Germany, you get educated about the Nazis\nquite intensely, especially in West Germany. They teach you\neverything, but they don't teach you drugs. Now they do, maybe,\nyou know. But it was not known, so the Nazis always had\nthis aura of being law and order. No drugs, of course. No\nchaos. Everything... My grandfather, he was a Nazi, always\nsaid, \"Well, at least there was discipline in the country. There was law and order.\"\nSo this doesn't match with drugs, you know? - You know, I should also say I think that's the\nexperience for a lot of people. Before reading your book, I had the same kind of feeling,\nthat the Nazi ideology was all about law and order and purity, and\nsurely they would not be doing drugs. So this really blew my mind. I think I wasn't quite ready, similar\nto Richard Evans. This is a big, like, okay, a narrative transforming into a deeper, more\ncomplicated understanding what Nazi forces and the Hitler inner\ncircle actually looked like. - That's why I didn't believe Alex. - Always take the DJ, the drug\nexpert, with a grain of salt. - I didn't believe him, but I said, \"It's a great topic.\nMaybe I could invent it.\" He said, \"No, we don't invent this. This is real.\" And I\nsaid, \"How do you know?\" And he said, \"I have a friend.\" And I know this guy\nby now. I met him. He's an antique dealer in Berlin, and he had\nbought an old medicine chest in an old Berlin apartment.\nThis was in 2010. And he found Pervitin tablets\ninside, which were the methamphetamine product that was\nmarketed in Germany in the late '30s. And this guy, the\nantique dealer, took some tablets and they\nwere quite old, you know, 70 years old, but they still had an\neffect on him. I later asked him, and he said, \"Well, we took them for\nabout a month. It was the greatest month we ever had. We had so much\nfun. We were so productive.\" 'Cause that methamphetamine\nback then was also a quality product. It was not crystal\nmeth made in a trailer lab, you know? - So this is many decades later. - They were still potent. - They were still potent. - Especially, Alex convinced me because\nAlex has a high tolerance and he said, \"Okay, they still had some.\" So\nI said to him, \"Can I have some also?\" I took one and he's\nlike, \"And this was... We were standing in my writing tower, which is at the\nriver in Berlin, and he was like, 'I took one, and I could feel\nsomething. Then I took another one,' and then it's, you know,\n'I could feel more.' And then I took a third one. Typical Alex,\nhe would take three, you know. Instead of just taking one, he took three\nmethamphetamine tablets from the 40s. And he said, \"And then I felt like...\"\nAnd he looked at the river. There was a big cargo\nship going by, and he said, \"I felt like this ship.\" Suddenly there\nwas this \"Shoop\" he said in German, like a motion that was like\nenergy that was grabbing me, and I felt so powerful.\nAnd he told me this, and I was like, \"Wow!\" This\nis like... And I Googled, \"Methamphetamine, Nazi Germany.\" This\nwas in 2010. And there was this one professor at the University\nin Ulm who said, \"The Blitzkrieg was only possible because of\nmethamphetamine.\" So I called up this guy and he said, \"Sure, I'll meet you.\" And then he\ngave me the signature for the archive. Then I went to the archive, and then I\nreally started to do my own research. Then I went to different archives, and\nI tried to find everything on Nazis and drugs. And that came...\nEverything is in the book. So that crazy meeting\nwith Alex in my writing tower, that kind of got me\non this research journey. - It makes me wonder what other\nmysteries like that are in the archives. Do you think there's stuff\nlike that in there that we deeply don't understand? I mean about, for example, there's a bunch of mysteries\nthat we think we understand maybe about the concentration\ncamps, maybe about the Eastern Front, the interplay\nbetween Stalin and Hitler. Maybe about Britain that\ncould be discovered in the letters, in the data\nthat were completely missing. - I think so. And I think that\nalso there are archives that are not open. Let's say the Vatican archive. Some secret archives that\nsome very powerful structures have, structures that we might\nnot even know, you know, now off the top of our head, which\nstill have a huge influence. So I think that human history\nis quite different from what most historians write. I think that's just one version. I\nthink there are several versions, and I think that it goes much\ndeeper and is much more interesting. So I guess this history is a very\nactive thing, which I also didn't know. You know, I was writing historical non-fiction book, and I suddenly\nrealized that this is like a shark pool because history defines the future or is very connected. Our history teacher\nalways said, \"If we don't know where we come from, we cannot\nknow where we go.\" And that is... That is, I think, true. That\nis what I now really am interested in for my next book. I'm\ntrying to really understand human history. And obviously, I'm not\nthe first. There are a few, you know, alternative historians that go\nlike... Because you have to go back in time quite a bit, and then\nit's not easy to write about it, but it's very interesting to think\nabout. And I would love to find the truth on Atlantis, which I don't believe in,\nactually, and we can also talk about that. But maybe there's an archive where\nwe can actually see that they had this king ruling. I don't think\nthis could be found, but, I think we can still also find a lot of documents, but I think especially in\nclosed archives. So we won't find them. - You said a lot of really interesting things.\nIt's so important to have people like you that do the daring work of going\nto the archives, the sources, the evidence and trying to find a\nthing that completely transforms history as we thought we understood it.\nThat's revisionist history at its best. Revisionist history has a\nsort of negative connotation sometimes because you go to\nconspiratorial land without much evidence, and you're just being\na rebel for rebels' sake. But when you ground it in data, and dare to challenge the historical\nnarrative, that's really powerful. So, I should also mention that we've been\njust setting, laying out the context. - Yeah. We're still in the context phase. - In context phase. And\nfor the next 10 hours, and maybe for the rest of our lives,\nwe will be continuing just setting the context. But let us dare return\nto the original question of, Pervitin. How did that come about?\nTake me to 1930s Nazi Germany. The Munich and the Berlin\ntension that we all laid out beautifully. How did Pervitin\ncome into the picture? - Well, the Nazis managed to grab\npower on January 30th, 1933, and they immediately became\nan anti-drug regime. That is important to them because the\nonly intoxication they allow from now on in Germany is the\nNazi intoxication; it's the ideological intoxication. So they quickly\ninstall concentration camps, which were, at the time, run\nby the SA, not the SS. The SS takes over later and turns\nthe concentration camps into an industry. The first SA\nconcentration camps were in cellars in Berlin or in the countryside.\nAnd some of the first people that landed in these cellars and were\ndisciplined were drug users. Also, anti-Semitic policies were very important\nfrom day one for the Nazis, like they. Anti-Semitism is the defining\npillar of National Socialism. of it, really. They quickly They connected anti-drug policies\nwith anti-Semitic policies. They claimed the Jews in Germany,\nthe German Jews were taking more drugs than the non-Jewish\nGermans. And National Socialism's goal was to purify the\nGerman body. So they saw the whole Volk, the Volk,\nthe country, the people, the country, the people, as one\nbody, and that has to be purified. and that has to be\npurified. So all Jews are poison. But not only\nJews, everyone who thinks differently. Communists are also poison.\nJews are the worst poison, but, you know, a lot of... Yeah, and then\nyou create this clean body. And obviously drugs have no position in\nthat. If you're addicted to drugs, that's weak, you know, you're a morphinist.\nYou use cocaine, that's all degenerate, that's Jewish.\nJewish doctors are all morphinists, you know? So Nazi\nGermany and Hitler was the shining example of the person who\ndoesn't take drugs. He was, he didn't have a private\nlife, he didn't even have a body. He just led the\nVolksbody, you know? So Hitler was not putting any poisons\ninto him. He stopped smoking cigarettes in the '20s already.\nHe never touched alcohol. - Vegetarian. - ...vegetarian, no caffeine even. So he was... That's what he was in\nthe beginning. The story, of course, changes at a certain point\nin time, but he started as this. - As far as you understand,\nthat's true? The beginning? - Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I'm\npretty sure that this is true. Also, vegetarianism was a right-wing thing\nin Germany. It was an elitist thing. If you were a vegetarian, you had a higher\nfrequency, which kind of gave you superiority over, let's say, these workers\nwho need to eat the sausage so you can, you know, do the work.\nLike Wagner, the composer, he was vegetarian. Hitler was\nimpressed by Wagner. So, vegetarianism, all... I think that's all\ntrue. I think Hitler was like that. And... And it's hard to be like that\nactually, and I think that gave him an attraction inside the\nmovement to all drunk, you know, drunkards and Goering using morphine all the time\nbecause of his pain, he got used to morphine, because of his pain, he got used to\nmorphine, so they were... The movement wasn't like this, but he\nwas like this. So he was, He symbolized, but he symbolized that\nwhole approach of cleanliness, like purity. So then how does\nmethamphetamine come into the picture? It's totally absurd. That's why\nI thought it was fun researching this, because it doesn't make sense, you know? And, you know, they use this\nsimple trick by, you know, defining what is an illegal\ndrug and what is not. Because drugs don't have it written on\nthem, \"This is an illegal, dangerous drug.\" You know, drugs are basically neutral.\nThese are molecules, you know? So the methamphetamine\nmolecule was found in a Berlin-based company called\nthe Temmler Company. And the head of Temmler,\nhe was very upset with the Olympics in 1936 because an\nAfro-American athlete, Jesse Owens, was running faster than German superheroes\nwith the best genes, you know? How can this be? So they thought that he was on something, because\nhe won, I think, five gold medals. It was ridiculous. This was\nsupposed to be Germany's games, you know, and then the Afro-American\nruns better than the Aryan ubermensch. So the only explanation is he took a\ndrug. He probably took Benzedrine, which was illegal amphetamine, and there were also no doping\nchecks at the Olympics. And if you're taking amphetamine, of\ncourse, you can run a bit faster maybe when it kicks in. That this has\nto do with the immense release of dopamine in the brain. But it was never proven that\nOwens used any type of drugs, but the head of the Temmler Company,\nhe said, \"We have to prevent this. We have to invent a better amphetamine. We\nhave to make a German amphetamine that is stronger than the American\nBenzedrine.\" So his main chemist, Fritz Hauschild, he did\nresearch and found that in 1917, in Tokyo, a Japanese chemist\nhad made methamphetamine, and he remade that methamphetamine\nand they tested it among themselves, the chemists in the Berlin\npharmaceutical lab, and they loved it. They made pure methamphetamine,\nand, you know, they had a really good time, and they were\nmore active, they were talkative. That's what happens with methamphetamine.\nSo the company really thought this is a great product, and\nthey turned it into a product. They went to the patent bureaucracy and\ngot the patent for methamphetamine, and then it quite quickly came onto the\nmarket. It was labeled as Pervitin, which is a great name, because it\nhas like the perverse already in it. And this Pervitin was available in any\npharmacy, so you didn't need a prescription. A child could go and buy 10 packs of pure methamphetamine. So methamphetamine\nwas also very cheap, so it became quite popular because\npeople, you know, talked about it. - Did they understand the side effects and\nnegative effects of methamphetamine? Did they care? - They didn't really know what it was. I\nmean, I also went to the archive of that company also, of course. So they\nwere like, \"What is it good for?\" Like, \"I just feel great when I\ntake it and I have more energy,\" and they didn't know if that\ncould be a product. It was 1937, '38 when they were discovering it. - But also, how did they think about\nthe fact that this is a drug? - Well, they called it a\nperformance enhancer. - Got it. - Is drinking coffee in the morning\na drug? I mean, it is a drug, but we don't think of it as a\ndrug, you know. It's legal. And this was kind of how meth was\ntreated in Germany. It was normal to use it. Like, you had a very important business\nmeeting, of course, you would take a Pervitin. There's a movie by\nBilly Wilder called 1, 2, 3, a very good movie, and he shows... the American executive... The\nmovie was set right after the end of the Second World War. So we see, I think it's a Coca-Cola\nexecutive, American, and he says to his secretary, \"How should I have the\nmorning coffee? I think half a Pervitin.\" So Pervitin was normal,\nit wasn't stigmatized. It was it was not the American \"just\nsay no\" propaganda, where your teeth fall out and... I mean, it was a\nGerman quality product, people liked it. Of course, they did tests at universities.\nBut most of them were quite positive. It reduces your fear. Today, we might, you know, look for different things,\nbut this was also a performance-driven, totalitarian society moving towards war. So if someone takes Pervitin and says\nin the clinical tests at university, \"I have- I'm not afraid of\nanything anymore.\" So that's positive. That's actually what got the\nguy who worked for the German army interested, because he read\nuniversity reports. Like I also saw all of these reports. They were also in\nthe military archive. So he's like, \"Okay, you're not afraid anymore if you take\nmethamphetamine. You don't need to sleep anymore. You don't need to eat so much,\n'cause your appetite is lowered.\" Like, this is perfect for a soldier. Negative effects only became\npublic in 1940, when the first Pervitin opponent,\nhe was actually a relative of Albert Speer, Hitler's architect, and\nlater armament minister. He was this Speer psychologist. He was the first one\nwho said, \"Wait a minute. First of all, methamphetamine is against the Nazi\nideology, because now we're all taking a drug to be high performers. We\nhave to be high performers without a drug.\" And he also said, \"You know this-\nthe obvious, this is gonna make you addicted,\" et cetera. \"This will, you\nknow, create a tolerance.\" So only then the first negative reports came out.\nBefore that, what Temmler did and then what the universities did, they all\nthought methamphetamine is really good. - So what was the process\nof convincing the German military, the Wehrmacht\narmy, to use it at scale? - Well, Professor Ranke was employed\nby the army, so it was his job to find things that would improve\nthe performance of the German soldier. I always imagined\nhim like a James Bond character, like Q, who develops\ngadgets and stuff, because he also developed gadgets. So he was quite a... you know, he\nwas an academic, but he was also a soldier, you know? He was employed, but\nhe was basically running this institute, examining it. And he was so convinced\nthat Pervitin is the answer to his question: how to beat the main opponent\nof the German soldier. And that was not the British soldier, not the French\nsoldier, not the Russian soldier. That was fatigue. He had been looking for\na way to keep a soldier awake longer. So when he read these reports from universities, he did his own\ntests in the military academy with young medical officers.\nThey came together at 8:00 PM in the evening, and then they received\neither methamphetamine, caffeine pill, or a placebo, or Benzedrine. They had\ndifferent experiments, and he always concluded at the end, like\nthey started at 8:00 PM and at 10:00 AM in the morning, one time he\nnotes, the Pervitin people still want to go out and party, while the\ncaffeine guys are sleeping on the bench. You know, it was clear\nthat Pervitin is the strongest. It gives you the most energy, lets you\nwork for the longest time. So he was convinced, but his superior, the Surgeon\nGeneral of the German army, was an old school dude, and he didn't\neven react to these. Ranke would write letters, \"We\nhave to use this synthetic drug in the next campaign,\" which\nwas against Poland, which he knew about. And because\nPervitin was quite known in the civil society, people were\nusing it already. So he even said, \"A lot of soldiers will just take it\nwith them, and we should control that.\" \"We should make it an official\ndrug.\" But the Surgeon General didn't understand. He didn't\nreply. So Germany attacked Poland without clear regulatory system on methamphetamine, and\nindeed, a lot of soldiers used it. And what Ranke then did was\nhe requested from all the medical officers in the field in\nPoland. The war was over after a few weeks. But the German army was\noccupying Poland. He said, \"Send me all reports, and tell me: Did your people take Pervitin and what were the effects?\" And he collected\nall these reports, which are also studied in the military archive, and he came to\nthe conclusion, \"This is a really good fighting drug.\" And it probably\nis, because people are still using it today. Methamphetamine is\nstill being used. And Ranke discovered this. He had everything in\nfront of him. And Poland was beaten, and then Hitler wanted to\nattack the West. And the West was a different story than Poland,\nbecause the West was the world empire of Great\nBritain combined with \"La Grande Armée,\" the strongest army in the\nworld, the French army. These two combined, you know, how\ncan you win that? Poland, they could overpower. They had, you\nknow, a better army than Poland. But is the German Wehrmacht really\nbetter than both of these armies combined? His officers didn't\nthink so. High Command said, \"No, we're not going to attack\nthe West. We're going to lose.\" And Hitler was fanatic about it,\nhe really wanted to attack. They were planning a coup against him\nin November 1939 just to prevent him ordering the attack on the West, because\nit would have been a catastrophe for Germany. Because they really cared, you\nknow? If you're High Command, you don't want to start a war that you're\ngoing to lose, you know? Very bad. - Can you just briefly give a sense of, do you think this is genius\nor insanity on Hitler's part to think that he can\ntake on probably what's perceived to be the most powerful military\nin the world, which is the French military, or at least in Europe? - I think his hatred for the\nFrench was very, very deep. He really, he really wanted to go\nto war with them. It was an ideological, irrational\ndecision. That's why he was not... He didn't hate the\nempire. He kind of looked down, he admired it and looked down on-- - You mean the British Empire? - But the French he really hated, and\nFrance had been the \"Erbfeind,\" the genetic enemy of the German people,\nat least right-wingers would say so. There had been two wars. The first one Germany had won, then\nthe First World War, Germany had lost. So Hitler wanted to\nkind of revenge and also stop the Treaty of Versailles. So he really\nneeded to attack the West, at least in his mindset. But it was an irrational\ndecision, and that's why High \"No, we're not going to do it,\" basically.\nAnd Hitler's position at the time was not that he could do\nanything he wanted. I mean, high command is still a high command\nof the German Wehrmacht. That's a very old, you know, it's\na tradition. It's... They, they do whatever they want,\nyou know? But also, they have to obey Hitler's orders. So it's\na power struggle, basically. But to invade France was a totally\nstupid idea, but it changed in the morning. On the morning\nof February 17th, 1940, Hitler invited three young\ntank generals to his office, and they had a plan, which was the plan\nto go through the Ardennes Mountains. That was the victorious\nidea. So it's not the drugs. Actually, that idea to go through the\nArdennes Mountain, if you think monocausal, you would say that's the\nreason. That idea was genius, and Hitler immediately understood\nit because before, the plan was to attack in the north of Belgium,\nwhich is the same as World War I. You... It becomes a stalemate and they\nfight for months, and no one really moves, and it's bloody, and nothing's\nhappening. It's a bad... But that was the only plan that they had. That's why the high\ncommand said, \"No, we're not going to do it. It's stupid.\" But these three\ntank generals, they had kind of somehow they were able to sneak into\nHitler's office, and they said, \"Look, if we go with the whole\narmy through the Ardennes Mountains,\" and like Hitler, \"Eh, this is\nnot possible. This is like a mountain range. How can the whole German\narmy fit through this eye of a needle, basically?\" And\nthey said, \"No, we can do it because everyone misunderstands what\ntanks can do. Tanks are not slow machines in the back\nthat kind of wait for the action to happen and then, you know, I don't\nknow, support it somehow. We're going to use tanks in the front as race\ncars, basically. We're gonna overpower the enemy.\nWe're gonna be in France before the French, who are stationed all\nwith the British in northern Belgium and also on the Maginot Line, but not\nreally in the Ardennes Mountains. That was hardly fortified because no one\ncould imagine that Germany would go through there. And before they\nknow it, we are already behind them, basically. We are\nalready in France, and they're still hanging out in northern Belgium\nbecause it takes quite a while, you know, to travel. This was a different time also. So he was convinced,\nand he then ordered the attack. The attack would\nhappen, but it would only work if you would reach Sedan, the border city\nof France, within three days and three nights. So the whole army, or at\nleast, you know, the avant-garde of the machinery, had to\nbe like a big part of the army, had to be in Sedan\nafter three days and three nights. And that was only\npossible if you don't stop. And that was the problem. The sleep\nsuddenly became a huge problem, and Hitler said, \"When I was fighting in World War I, of course I could\nstay awake for a week. I'm a German.\" You know, even though\nhe's not even German, he's Austrian. But that was a problem. Suddenly Ranke realized that his moment\nhad come because he had the recipe of how people could stay awake for three\ndays and three nights. So Ranke suddenly So Ranke suddenly became... Before that, he was\nkind of an outsider, a freak with a drug idea. Suddenly, he became, \"Okay,\ntell us, how does it work?\" And he gave lectures in front of the\nofficers, and he wrote a stimulant decree where a whole army\nis prescribed a drug, in this case, methamphetamine.\n\"How much should be taken? At what intervals? What are the side\neffects?\" This became a very big thing. And then Temmler had to\ndeliver 35 million dosages to the front lines, which were... No,\nnot the front yet. They were stationed in the west of Germany. Then on May 10th, they took their\nmethamphetamine, and they started the surprise attack through\nthe Ardennes Mountains. - So the 35 million dosages\nfor the French campaign. I mean, we could probably\ntalk for many hours about this particular campaign,\nbecause it is, I think, it's fair to say, the most successful\nmilitary campaign from the German side. - Ended with a big mistake, Dunkirk. - Dunkirk. - It was brilliant up until that\npoint. That is the turning point. That was the first big mistake Hitler\nmade, and it also had to do with drugs. - We'll talk about it, but let's\njust linger on this three days. - Right. - We should also mention that's\nwhere Blitzkrieg really shined. So it wasn't just the tanks,\nit was the infantry, it was the aircraft moving very fast behind the\nFrench lines. I mean, what can you speak to just the execution of that\ncampaign and the role of drugs in it? And we should say it's a really bold\nstrategic decision to use meth. I mean, it's a big risk. There\nare a lot of risks taken here, which could be seen as\nmilitary genius or military insanity, or a mixture of both. - Well, they were very lucky\nthat it all worked out. Also, the guys in the tanks could have\nall freaked out on the meth. It was never tested before, \"Can you\nactually be in a combat situation, in a tank, in enemy territory,\non meth? Can people actually cope with that\nand be better fighters?\" - Going through the mountains... - It's insane, yeah. - ...against the biggest military in Europe. - Well, what meth does is... I read\nreports of a depressed atmosphere right before the attack started\nbecause they were afraid. They thought they would lose. They\ndidn't want that. You know, soldiers, maybe some really hardcore Nazi soldiers,\nbut most people were normal guys. They didn't want to start\nthat. But once they had the methamphetamine, it kind\nof... you're in a party mood. So also, when you're in the\ntank, everyone likes it. It's rather an uplifting thing.\nThey were really getting into it, and they really started\nfighting then. It's also intoxication, you know? It's a rush. - What does meth feel like? - Well, meth creates the so-called\nfight or flight modus. releases all the neurotransmitters\nin the brain which are released in situations of high danger,\nfor example. So in a highly dangerous situation, you become very\nalert, so you can cope with the situation, if you're, like,\nunder life threat and you don't even react to it, you're probably\ngonna be dead, you know? But the body does that,\nand methamphetamine does that. So you take a pill of\nmethamphetamine or you snort a line of methamphetamine and you're like this. And, then it's the fight or flight mode. Either\nyou run away like it's too much, you know? But on meth, you usually don't\nrun away. You kind of think it's really cool what's happening. You like to\nmove, you like to be with your pals, you like to, you know, be in a\ntank is great on meth. - So there is a party aspect to it? - I think it was very joyful for the\nGerman soldiers because it was springtime. They had immediate successes.\nAnd it wasn't heavy fighting, it was just being in the tank. I mean, there was, of course,\nfighting and there were also war crimes. And I read a report when\nRommel, high on meth, at night, doesn't stop, of\ncourse, because they all, you know... They didn't stop at night, but every\narmy usually stops at night. So the French army were stopping. They were in a village camping out, and the\nGerman, Rommel, was going with the tank through that\nvillage with his division, just running over people. And he\nwas standing like in the open lid of the tank, and he was like,\ngoing through that thing, you know, and you know, like a\nberserk type of warrior. And that was when... That to me is a war crime. That is when the\nWehrmacht lost its innocence in that push of Rommel through\nthe French countryside. Because you don't do that, you know? Your\nenemy is sleeping. Because the French also had a drug regulation. They\nreceived three quarters of a liter of red wine per man\nper day. So, of course, at night, they're going to be sleepy\non red wine, and the Germans were on meth and they were just running\nover them. There's descriptions of the chains of the tank becoming bloody. I don't\nthink he did it, and he was like, \"Oh my God, what did I just do? I'm\nsorry.\" \"What am I doing here?\" He was in the movie, you know? - This is the dark thing\nabout human nature, that in war, if you dehumanize,\nif you allow your brain to dehumanize the enemy, the opponent,\nthe humans on the other side, you can actually... I think hate can take over, and in that hate you can find\npleasure when you murder the other. And people have written about this, they've\ntalked about this. It's probably a thing that a person like me can't possibly\ncomprehend unless they experienced it. And you have to be in the mania, in\nthe hysteria, in the insanity intensity of war. - I mean, what Evans, for example,\nsaid is that, \"I excuse the Germans of the war crimes because\nthey were just in an intoxication.\" I understand that argument, but... And if you look at individual soldiers,\nit's quite tricky. Like, it's a 19-year-old guy, he's been drafted.\nAnd in Nazi Germany, if you don't go, you land in the concentration camp. So you\ncan choose, you know, concentration camp or you just join the ranks and then\nyou get Pervitin and then you invade France. There was a trial\nin Germany because someone said all soldiers are\nmurderers. And I think then the German Bundeswehr sued him.\n\"No, soldiers are not murderers.\" And he actually won in court. So it's\nlegal in Germany to call every soldier a murderer. But\nit's a tricky question. - Yeah, I remember seeing this documentary on the\nordinary people. I think there's also social pressure. Again, insane it is to say, I think\nthe documentary, Ordinary People, was looking at the Germans that\nwere a part of the shooting squads. And, you know, they didn't\nunderstand what they're signing up for, and they were told\nthat they're free to leave once they understand what they're doing, and\nmany of them didn't. And they didn't have hate for Jews or for the people\nwho they're murdering. You are, again, a 19, 20-year-old young kid, like, it's so hard to comprehend the moral\ninsanity that's happening all around you and you just kind of want to fit in. - I mean, that's why I wrote the book, The\nBohemians, because there were a few people in Berlin that didn't react this\nway, but they reacted in a different way. They said,\n\"We cannot be part of this.\" - But it's hard to be the person— - It's very hard, yeah. And\nmost people are part of it because it's much more safe, or at least\nit seems more safe. I mean, it has its own perils, you know. Because you\nmight become a genocidal murderer, you know. That might happen.\nLike, are you responsible? I would say you are\nresponsible, but that's just my personal gut feeling.\nLike, I always thought my grandfather was responsible for the\ngenocide because he was working for the German railway system, and\nhe once saw a train car full of Jews in a cattle wagon, and he only said to me, \"Yeah, this was against\nGerman railway regulations.\" And I said, \"So what did you do?\" And he said,\n\"Well, there were SS at the station when I was working, and I was too scared. I didn't do anything.\" So I thought that he was... he made himself guilty, I\nthought. That's... and my father, for example, reacted very strongly\nbecause of that. He never called him by his first name, the father of his wife, because he still had that, you know, he was a\nNazi because he was working for the railway. So I wouldn't excuse... I\nwouldn't excuse people actually, and I certainly would not excuse high-ranking\npoliticians that make policies because the genocidal policies that the Nazis developed and the war policies\nthat they developed had nothing to do with drugs. And I never write\nthat in any, you know, because there's no documents. If I would find documents\nthat say, \"Yeah, when we...\" you know, but this the Nazi ideology has\nnothing to do with drugs. Maybe with alcohol, you know, but\nit's... and I spoke with my father, who had been a high judge in Germany.\nWhat does actually the law say, and the law says if you plan a crime and then maybe when you commit it,\nyou are under the influence, it does not diminish your responsibility. Your responsibility is only diminished...\nLet's say you're a totally normal person, never done any harm to anybody,\nand suddenly you take a drug that... or you're totally drunk, and you\ndon't know what you're doing and you kill someone. Then a judge could\nsay maybe you have a lesser responsibility. But this is not the case with the crimes of National\nSocialism, and I never even hint at that in my book. So I\nthink that criticism by Evans was short-sighted. I wouldn't... I\nthink he's not right about that. - Yeah, I think I agree with you\ntotally. I didn't get that sense. - He thought the book was very successful\nbecause a lot of right-wing people bought it, but that's not...\nit's simply not true. - I think your book did a\nmasterful job of never making itself amenable to\nthat kind of narrative. - To the contrary, I got an\nangry letter by a German army employee, quite a high officer and a\nmilitary historian, and he said that I... he also thought I\noveremphasized the drug use of the methamphetamine in the western\ncampaign because he said the German army was just so good,\nand you kind of diminish their capability by saying they\nwere only so good because they took methamphetamine. I thought that was\nkind of funny because the Wehrmacht doesn't exist anymore, and the current\nGerman army is called the Bundeswehr, and they're not... historically, they're not\nsupposed to be connected. Like, there was a clear-cut, but he still felt\nthat I was kind of hurting the pride of the Wehrmacht, so. - I generally sort of agree with him. In\ngeneral, it seems like great historians often... I'm just a human, so I'm\nnot a historian, but they undermine the importance of the\nheroes that make up an army. The Soviet Army, the\nBritish Army, the French Army, the German Army. These are humans, and\nsome of the great military campaigns involve people really\nstepping up. Now, the effectiveness of the military tactics\nwith blitzkrieg, the effectiveness of meth, the strategic\ndecisions around where to invade, the timing, the speed, all\nthose are important, but there's humans there. There's real heroes. And\nsometimes historians kind of diminish that. I don't know what to make\nsense of it. I might be just an idiot, but I've had a great conversation with James\nHolland. I've gotten to know him well. He kind of analyzed the mistakes\nmade by Hitler and by Stalin in the Operation Barbarossa. But I just, through generations,\nbecause I grew up in the Soviet Union, you hear these stories\nof these heroes, you know. My grandfather was a machine gunner and miraculously survived. And,\nlike, and just knowing those stories, Stalingrad would not\nhave happened without the heroes on the Soviet side. It's easy\nto say there's a lot of blunders, a lot of bad tactics, all this\nkind of stuff, but to me, from the human side, I just know through my\nbloodline, the people that have fearlessly given their life\nto defend their homeland, and that sometimes can be a little bit\neasily dismissed. So, I don't know what to make sense of it. Maybe I'm\nromanticizing or maybe I'm speaking to the suffering that the people\nhave felt, and they just propagate themselves through my life\nstory, and then maybe the gratitude I have for the people who have\nstopped the Nazi forces. - I think it's amazing what the Russian\nsoldiers actually did because they beat the Wehrmacht. It\nwas really the Red Army on the ground that did the job,\nyou know. And did they love communism and the system? I don't think\nso, and I think they were... I mean, of course, some people, but basically, they\nwere defending their country, and... I'm also very grateful to them. - Yeah, they're defending their\nfamilies. Quick pause. Bathroom break? - Okay. - All right, we're back. So can you say a\nbit more about the French campaigns in, um... It was over in six weeks. It\ntook six weeks to defeat and occupy most of France. And the\ninitial operation, three days, was, from a military\nperspective, successful. What else can we say about the role of drugs, the effectiveness, what was learned\nfrom that experience by the Wehrmacht? - I mean, for me to research the\nWestern campaign was very interesting because I didn't really know anything\nabout it except that Germany won very quickly. So to actually look at\nthe details is very interesting, and the drugs give you a way in. - What are some things you found in the archives\nthat were interesting, like, about maybe letters, reports, diaries,\nthat gave you some insight about the human story of it all? - Well, there are letters, for example,\nby Heinrich Böll, who won the Nobel Prize later in literature. He writes\nto his parents describing in detail what Pervitin did to him,\nhow it kept his mood up, and that without Pervitin, he\nwouldn't have been able to do the job. But also military documents\nI found very interesting. For example, I could see exactly\nhow the methamphetamine was distributed because it was\nnot distributed equally. It was done in a way that the tank troops\nwho were leading the advance received the most meth, and they also needed it. I could see how many pills\non which date were delivered to Rommel's troops. And Rommel\nbecame, I call him the Crystal Fox in my book for obvious reasons. His\ndivision was using a lot of meth. - And he was using meth as well? - I just have descriptions\nhow he, like, totally crazy stands in the open lid of the tank and\nall his people, well, they had the meth, but there's no- - So you can infer from that. - There's no, maybe they didn't\nuse it. Maybe he didn't use it. But it looks like he used it. There\nwere also never any reports that all the meth was given back. I\nmean, a lot of soldiers write that they take it, but Rommel specifically,\nI wouldn't write in my book, Blitz, that Rommel would take methamphetamine. on such a day or something if there\nwas no record for it. But Rommel, there is a record for it that\nRommel's division used the most meth of any tank division. So,\nI write about that. And that's, that already makes him the\nCrystal Fox because, you know, in his division, crystal\nmeth is, you know, rampant. - You know, it's like in Animal\nFarm when the pigs discover alcohol. Animal Farm by George\nOrwell. There's no evidence that they drank. It's just the next day\nthat they're all hungover. - I mean, Rommel is a very interesting\ncharacter in general because later he turned, apparently,\nturned against Hitler. He was part of the conspiracy of Operation\nValkyrie. He received, you know, the offer to shoot\nhimself in the forest, which he did instead of\nbeing tried and executed. - Is he just part of this general\ntension that the generals, the military had with Hitler?\nWould that be fair to say? - I would say so, yes. I'm not\nan expert on the Wehrmacht. This is a very complex,\nlarge organization. But I see most of the officers\nof the Wehrmacht as not necessarily Nazis in the way that they would,\nyou know, shout, \"Heil Hitler,\" all the time. They were highly intelligent, highly\ntrained, super professionals that ran a very effective war machine. And at one point, more and more of these generals\nrealized that the orders that Hitler was giving were not really\nhelping, you know, and they have their men dying because of it. So that creates\na lot of tension. And that led to the mistake that Hitler did in Dunkirk, basically. What Churchill called\nthe sickle cut, which was the idea to storm through the Ardennes Mountains\nand kind of cut off the British and French troops who were still, you know, in the north\nof Belgium trying to figure out what was going on. Suddenly, the Germans are\nbehind them, so they kind of cut like a sickle into enemy territory,\nthe sickle cut. That was so successful that, basically, the campaign\nwas won already. So then the Germans invaded, like occupied all\nthe cities on the canal back to England to kind of cut off\nthe British completely, so they couldn't, you know, even flee.\nBut Dunkirk was open, the last port that was open. And\nthe German army was like, you know, they were already on the outskirts\nof Dunkirk. They could have just taken it and closed that, you know, that hole\nfor the British military to get out. But Hitler then did his famous...\nAnd this is all the dynamic of the Western campaign, you know.\nA lot of things happen every day. And then they're saying like, \"We're going\nto have Dunkirk tomorrow and then it's over.\" And then Hitler stops\nthe tanks. It's his famous Halte Befehl, the order to stop. And you know, they were all on meth. They\ndidn't want to stop. But Hitler was not on meth. Hitler was, he was, he- he\nbasically, it was a little bit similar than Berlin, Munich thing. Hitler didn't really understand that campaign. It was\ntoo fast for him. He... Because they didn't say like, \"Oh, they're all on meth. They're\nnot going to sleep. They're going to behave erratically.\" They didn't discuss this. They discussed this\nin the old-fashioned terms. And Hitler was seeing like, \"They do not protect\ntheir flanks. What if the British come from the\nnorth?\" This is terrible. Militarily, it was, they\nwere already fighting World War II, while Hitler was\nstill fighting World War I. And especially the Allies, they were still\nfighting World War I. But the tank generals on meth, or the tank generals without meth, the\ntank generals per se, they were fighting a new type of war. And Hitler then got a visit from Goering,\nthe head of the air force, the Luftwaffe. And Goering was a\nmorphinist. That is very well documented. He was on morphine.\nHe was high as a kite most of the time. And that comes with losing touch\nwith reality, I would say, or at least it changes your grip on reality, you\nknow. Maybe you're still a good decision-maker, but it could\nlead to... You know, if you're intoxicated, let's say you're writing, and you're\nintoxicated, you think it's great, but the next day you read it, and it's shit, you know? Goering was using morphine in the\nmorning, then met Hitler at the Felsennest, which was Hitler's\nheadquarters to command the Western campaign, the\nFelsennest. And Goering said to him, \"If the army generals are\nnow gonna take Dunkirk, then basically the army has won\nthis campaign, and that will give army high command, which\nis already against you,\" because they were, you know, for\nthem, Hitler was always like, \"der kleine Gefreite,\" like this\nsmall, kind of regular army guy because that's what Hitler had\nbeen in the First World War, and now suddenly, he was the big decision-maker. So\nthey never, they thought they make much better decisions than him. So Goering\nsays, \"Their power will be so overwhelming that they will, from now on,\ncall the shots how this war will continue and what will be done next.\nYou should let me with the Luftwaffe do the job from\nthe air. The National Socialist Luftwaffe is gonna end\nthe Western campaign.\" So he thought that he could\ndestroy... It doesn't make sense, you know. Even to destroy\nthe British military from with planes, maybe you can do it.\nBut certainly, he couldn't do it. So the tank generals received the Haltebefehl, the stopping order.\nThey didn't believe it when they received it, because the victory,\nthis would've been complete victory over Great Britain. This would've\nbeen the end of Great Britain. The whole British military was\nencircled, but they did get out through Dunkirk. That's why the movie Dunkirk\nwith Christopher Nolan is not good because he doesn't describe what happened on the\nGerman side. It's just this heroic British thing, \"Yeah, we just got\nout and we reformed, and then we beat...\" You know. This was just\nbecause Hitler was afraid of the power of his army high command, and\nconvinced by Goering's morphine-high vision that he would stop it with\nthe air force, which he couldn't, which he couldn't. I mean, he bombed, and then the British,\nyou know, they were on ships, and a few ships were sunk, but basically, they got, they got out.\nYou need to do this on the ground. At least back then, you would've needed to do it on\nthe ground. So that was a big mistake by Hitler. That's why von Manstein,\none of the three tank generals from February 17th, it was Rommel, von\nManstein, and Guderian, and von Manstein, he later said, he spoke of a \"lost victory.\" He said the Western\ncampaign was a lost victory because we really could have\nachieved the victory. We could've dominated, you know, Britain. They\ncould've invaded Britain. There was no more military. - Well, okay. On land, yes. - There was still the Royal Air Force. - And the Navy. - And the Navy, yeah. - So, invading Britain, I think any\ninvasion of actual Britain is a gigantic mistake on the Nazi part, but- - But if Britain doesn't have a standing\narmy anymore, it's much easier- - Well, I- - ...than still have one. - I think it's still extremely difficult to\ninvade, but it's much easier to sort of neutralize, make sure that Britain is\nnot a player in the war. I mean, the co- mean, the co- - For sure. Maybe Hitler wouldn't\nhave invaded at all, anyhow. - Also, because of his sort of,\nnot respect, but non-hatred- - Right - ...of the British Empire. - Because they're also\nwhite supremacists, so ...Why would we fight them? You know, it doesn't make\nsense. While the French, they were already like half black, basically, in Hitler's eyes. - If we're to talk about\ncounterfactual history of the possible trajectories of the\nwar that would lead to Nazi victory, one of the big mistakes is the\ninvasion of Britain. So you already mentioned the stake with Dunkirk, but\nbeyond that, if they even captured mainland Europe, they could've just\nneutralized the British threat and not invaded Britain, and then go after the oil, which is much\nneeded maybe in the Middle East. So focus on that campaign\nbefore invading the Soviet Union. And then maybe wait for the\nSoviet Union to invade them through Poland, which would be\nlikely coming, or wait until 1943, something like this, to invade east\nwithout the Western front having to be, been there. And the other\nreally big mistake is declaring war against the United States.\nHaving complete disrespect for the United States and declaring war on the United\nStates. Which didn't have to be done at all. So it's collecting enemies\nwhen those didn't have to be. So there is, to me actually,\nthere's a lot of paths there, as dark as it is to\nimagine for Nazi Germany to be successful in the invasion\nof the Soviet Union, even. - Well, I think that's why the Wehrmacht officers\nwere pissed at Hitler, because they knew that they could actually win if it was done in a\ncertain way. But Hitler's ideology and his stupidity... and later also, his\ndegeneration of his cognitive abilities did not allow the Wehrmacht to\nfight in a most effective way. Hitler was a very bad\nleader after Dunkirk. - So can you speak to the morphine?\nWhat kind of drug is morphine? - Morphine was developed in the 19th century by\na German, a young chemist called Sertürner. A German, a young chemist\ncalled Sertürner. He wanted to know what the potent alkaloid is\nin opium. Because opium is a natural drug, but there's something in the\nopium that is actually decisive, and that's morphine. So he was able\nto extract that from the opium. So he basically, this young guy,\ninvented morphine, which then became this young guy, he invented morphine, which\nthen became, you know, very important in wars. Very important in wars, especially\nlike the American Civil War is unthinkable without morphine. Or at\nleast it would have been very different, because with morphine, you can treat people,\nyou can amputate people, you can fix people up, you can fix people up, and send them back into battle.\nAnd that also corresponded with the development of the hypodermic needle, the injection\nneedle. Needle, the injection needle. That was around in the mid-19th century.\nSo the injection needle and morphine together became a very efficient\nway to treat soldiers. And that prolonged, for example,\nthe Civil War in America. - So Göring was taking morphine. - Yeah. Morphine is like the classic.\nYou don't eat opium, you know? You don't eat opium, you know?\nYou take what is active in opium, and you inject it, and that's a much...\nThat's a very potent... You know, potent... You know, that numbs all your pain. You don't have pain\nanymore if you're on morphine. Morphine. - It also affects judgment. - I've never taken morphine, so I cannot\nreally say. There are a few junkies that are highly creative on it. A\nlot of musicians in the '60s were using heroin, which is a more potent form,\nor it's a half-synthetic. It's an opioid. form, or it's a half-synthetic.\nIt's an opioid. Morphine is an opiate, and heroin's an opioid.\nI guess you could be quite sharp on it also. That's why Hitler liked Eukodal,\nwhich is OxyContin, oxycodone. OxyContin, oxycodone.\nAnd he injected that. - Which is another opiate, heroin-like. - It was a product by the Merck\ncompany from Darmstadt, Germany. They made Eukodal, which when\nGermany lost the war, the patent was basically taken by America and\nthen ended up in oxycodone. So if you inject Eukodal, that was\na very popular drug in the '20s. Because apparently, it gives you\nthe most beautiful high on Earth. You're like super high.\nYou feel extremely well, and you can think very clearly. And you\nfeel like this is how life should feel. High on Eukodal, this is like Klaus\nMann, the son of Thomas Mann. He used Eukodal. Quite a few\ndoctors actually used it also, and probably quite a few Jewish doctors also\nused it, because this was like a doctor's drug. Doctors knew how to, you\nknow, set the injection. And it was a great experience.\nAnd Hitler, he really loved to be on Eukodal. He would use Eukodal every\nsecond day. In the beginning, 10 milligrams intravenously, then he raised\nto 20 milligrams. And I spoke to someone who's actually\ndone exactly that drug application, because I wanted\nto know how Hitler felt, and I didn't feel like doing it myself\nfor some reason. I don't like needles, so I didn't want to put a needle\nin my vein to have the Hitler drug experience. I should have done it.\nLike a historian, a proper historian never does that, okay? But\nI thought I should take quite a few drugs that I write about\nto understand it better. But this drug I didn't take. I never shot oxycodone\nintravenously into my veins. But I met someone who did,\nand he said it's like the, it's like the king's high. You know, if\nyou do that properly, obviously you get addicted to it, you know? - I'd be scared to try. - Very intense experience. - I think it's a very badass thing\nto do for a historian, by the way. But I think it's a big risk.\nI think, I mean, there is a risk that comes along with it, right? - Well, but not for Hitler, because he\ngot the Eukodal from the pharmacy. He knew exactly, like his doctor knew\nexactly what was inside. It was made by a pharmaceutical company. - No, I mean, the risk of addiction. - Yeah, that is a big risk. But there's also\nthe risk of getting impure stuff and- - Yes, yes - like heroin on the street and die\nfrom an overdose or... But the addiction thing is very... I think it happens\nquite quickly with Eukodal, because it's such a great feeling. So why wouldn't you do\nit over and over again? Because... And then the opioid receptors in the brain want you to take it. And if you don't take\nit, you get withdrawal symptoms and you feel like shit. And you have to... So\nthat's the problem with opioids, with morphine. That's what happens. And\nthat's what happened to Hitler. - I generally say yes to most things, but\nthose drugs, like cocaine doesn't scare me. Heroin scares me. The opioids\nscare me. Oxycodone scares me. - Because they really make\nyou physically dependent. I don't even know if cocaine makes you\nphysically dependent. It makes you psychologically addicted. But you actually have to get it,\notherwise you feel bad. That's a physical, terrible addiction. - And also for life to feel like less\nwhen you're not on it. That scares me. - That's the problem also with methamphetamine.\nPeople who use a lot of methamphetamine, on days they don't use it, they don't\nfeel great at all, especially not compared to the methamphetamine\ndays. So that became a problem in Germany when people were really\nusing more and more of the Pervitin. - All right, you got to take me through\nthe full drug cocktail that Hitler was on. Patient A of Morell's.\nLet's start at the beginning. We're big on setting\ncontext here. So tell the story of Dr. Theodor Morell.\nHow did he meet Hitler? - Well, Morell was ...\nHe had his practice on Kurfürstendamm, which is like the main\nboulevard of Berlin, in the west of Berlin. Kind of a fancy street.\nAnd he was a celebrity doctor, which was a new type of doctor,\nin a way, a Dr. Feelgood. He kind of was one of the first Dr. Feelgoods.\nSo you didn't go to him when you had a disease. You went to him when you\nwere... Let's say you were an opera star in the Berlin Opera, and you had a\nbig premiere, so you would go to Morell in the afternoon, and he would give you a\nnice shot, and then you would, you know, be So he... But he was not a quack. I\nmean, he was... He just knew his drugs, and he believed in, you know,\nwhy shouldn't you treat someone even if that person doesn't\nhave a disease? If you can make that person feel better, it's good,\nespecially if that person pays. Like, he said, \"Everyone who pays\nmy...\" And he wasn't cheap. \"Who comes to me and wants a testosterone hormone\ninjection or a vitamin injection or an opioid injection, you get it from\nhim.\" He didn't have any scruples. - I mean, but we should also say,\nhe was pretty innovative and extremely knowledgeable. So you\nmentioned hormones, but also, you know, like probiotics. Like, you\ntalk about— Just he knew his shit. - He was a bit of a nerd. - Like, a legit doctor, just didn't\nhave boundaries about what he used. - He had a very unappealing\nphysical appearance, and I think that was a problem for him,\nand he was known to have very bad eating habits. Like, sauce was running,\nand... So people were easily disgusted by him. He was like an\noutsider. He was really like a freak. But when people\nlooked at him after he had given them an injection and they said,\n\"Thank you,\" and \"I feel so great now,\" that's what kind of made\nhis day, you know? So one day, a man entered his doctor's office on Kurfürstendamm named\nHubertus Hoffmann. And Hube— Hubertus Hoffmann was a photographer,\nand he had gonorrhea. And Morell, because he knew about alternative\nways to treat, he actually cured him. And Hubertus Hoffmann said to Morell, \"I have a good friend, and I think you\nshould meet him, and I'm gonna have a dinner in Munich, and I think it\nwould be really worth your time to come.\" And Morell came, and\nthe good friend was Hitler, because Hubertus Hoffmann was\nthe photographer of Hitler. And they were... In German\nwe have a \"you,\" a formal you, which is \"Sie.\" Like, if I\ndon't know you so well, I say \"Sie.\" And if you're my close\nfriend, I say \"du,\" you. And Hitler only had about four\npeople he would say \"you\" to. He would always like the \"Sie,\"\nlike the distance. It was always about distance and respect\nand borders and boundaries. - What are the two again? \"Sie\" and what? - \"Du.\" - \"Sie\" and \"du\"? - Yeah. \"Sie\" is the formal one,\nand \"du\" is the informal one. - Yeah. In Russian, there's the\nsame thing: \"vy\" and \"ty.\" So there's a big... That's a big thing. - Also in French, you also have\nthat. You have that in Spanish. Only in English you don't have it. - And it is part of the\ncultural sort of discourse, of, like, when you\nupgrade from the \"vy\"... - Right - ...to the \"ty,\" from the\n\"Sie\" to the \"du\"... - Yeah - ...or from the \"du\" to the \"Sie.\" - From the \"Sie\" to the \"du.\" - \"Sie\" to the \"du.\" - That would be the upgrade,\nbecause you become more intimate. - Yeah, like, and you ask, \"Can I go-\" - Yeah. - ...from \"Sie\" to \"du\"?\" - Yeah. Like, the older person\nmust suggest it, I think. - Yeah. Okay. Beautiful. Language. - So Hoffmann was a \"du freund,\"\na \"du freund,\" we say, of Hitler. So he was quite close to\nHitler, and that's why he could also make that close connection. So he had a\ndinner with just him, Hitler, Eva Braun, Hitler's girlfriend, and\nMorell came. They sent a plane to Berlin to pick him up, so it's like VIP\ntreatment. It was- ...the whole thing. - And this is 1936? - '36. Yeah, they had spaghetti with\ntomato sauce on the side, I read in the... There's like a description\nof this event. The tomato sauce was on the side. And there was Muscat.\nWhat is Muscat? It's a spice. Nutmeg. - Nutmeg. - Yeah, it was with nutmeg, which is an unusual\nrecipe, I guess, but that's what they had. And spaghetti wasn't a fancy\nthing, you know? It came from Italy, from Mussolini, who\ninvented fascism in Italy, and who was like Hitler's role model for a\nlong time until Hitler surpassed him, obviously. So the spaghetti\nthat came from Italy, and it was a big thing. And\nMorell had the big problem that spaghetti's hard to eat, right?\nAnd he couldn't even like it. It was a It was a catastrophe. But\nhe got out of it because Hitler complained about stomach\nproblems cause Hitler was a terrible vegetarian. He was a\nso-called cake vegetarian. He would only eat sweets, like cake. No\nmeat of course, but he wouldn't eat healthy stuff, you know?\nSo he was bloated the whole time, because he only ate cake\nand white bread, and it's not good. So he voiced that,\nand there was also a Brandt was there, like his\nofficial doctor from the SS that was his doctor, and Hitler said, \"My doctors can't cure me.\" And Morell was\nlike, \"This is my chance. Thank you, God.\" And he told Hitler about the\nprobiotics, which Hitler had never heard of. And also Brandt, the doctor, he hadn't\nheard of, because that was a new thing that you give. And he- Hitler was\nasking, \"What is that?\" And Morell said, \"These are live bacteria\nfrom German soldiers from the war in the First World War that were\nfighting in Serbia.\" There was one guy who didn't get the stomach flu\nwhen all the others, like, drank the water in Serbia and all got sick. But\nthis one guy, so his bacteria... And this is a true story. His gut\nbacteria were cultivated into a medicine called Mutaflor.\nAnd Morell told Hitler about this and he said, \"This is amazing.\nI have to try this,\" you know? And it helped, you know? He got the\nMutaflor, he did the Mutaflor kind of therapy and it cured him.\nHe suddenly had no bloating anymore, and the farting of Hitler\nwas really bad. So bad that he'd- it would, like, diminish his ability to work, you know? So suddenly\nhe could work. He said he felt better. He didn't have the pain. He felt\ngreat, so he really thought that Morell is a wonder doctor. And\nhe asked Morell pretty quickly afterwards, \"Do you want to be my\npersonal physician?\" And Morell's wife was very much against it because she\nsaid, \"If you become the personal physician of Hitler, you won't have any time for\nme anymore.\" And he said like, \"Come on, man. This is the chance you\nonly get once in your life.\" - Yeah, I mean, at this point,\nHitler's a really big deal. - He's the most powerful man in Europe. And there have not been\nwar crimes 'cause the war hasn't started yet. Obviously\nthere's concentration camps and a lot of crimes have been committed,\nbut it's also kind of hushed up, you know? It was...\nit's not such a huge thing as now we know it became. So,\nMorell never really has any conscientious problems. He just thought it's\ngreat, you know. \"I'm going to be the doctor. I'm going to be part of history.\" So\nhe becomes the personal physician, and being this vitamin guy, like vitamins\nwere really his thing. He believed in the power of vitamins. And\ntoday I think we know that he was right. Vitamins are good,\nbut back then, no one knew. And Hitler was like,\n\"Okay.\" He told Hitler, and then Hitler said, \"Okay, I want to\ntry these vitamins and...\" what they did from the beginning was injections because\nHitler didn't want to take a pill, 'cause the pill takes too long and it goes\nthrough the- the track that he has the problems with, like the digestion.\nLike he didn't want to take a pill. He believed in the injection,\nand Morell was the masterful injector. So Morell, because the\nneedles were thicker than they are today, but Morell could give\nyou an injection without you feeling any pain. So Hitler was quite impressed, so he got\nlike a vitamin C injection, but Hitler loved the daily so he got like a vitamin C injection, but Hitler loved\nthe daily injection, so he got hooked on the daily injection, so he got hooked on the daily injection.\nOnce he got the injection, the day was good. injection. Once he got the\ninjection, the day was good. And he never got sick, actually. And he could stand like for a long\ntime with the arm raised. He did, he went to the gym, basically. arm raised. He did, he went to the gym, basically. I mean, he had\na gym where he was doing exercise so he could have his arm up mean, he had a gym where he was doing exercise so he could have his arm up for\nlike hours when a military parade would walk by. So he was quite fit and he for like hours when a military parade would walk by. So he was quite fit\nand he was never sick and Morell was giving him the daily injection and was never sick and Morell was giving him the daily injection and they\nlived happily ever after, basically, until the Soviet Union attacked. they- they lived happily ever after\nbasically until the Soviet Union attacked. - Wait, wait, wait. He literally lifted\nso he could do the Heil Hitler salute? salute? - Yeah, I found a document for that.\nThat's funny. Oh God, that's dark. - That's funny. Oh God, that's dark. - He had an expander, we say. I don't know, do you use\nthat word in English? Expander? Oh, like a band. - Oh, like a- a band. - Yeah, it's like this. You do like...\nYeah, yeah, I have one of those. - Yeah, yeah, I have one of those. - Yeah, that's what, that's what- Wow. - Wow. - That's what he did. In front of the-\nAnd I do those kinds of exercises. - And I do those kinds of exercises. - ...in front of the window. Well, at least he's not\ndoing it in front of a mirror. Okay, wow, that's dark. - Well, at least he's not doing it in front\nof a mirror. Okay, wow, that's dark. Okay. That's... I mean, those little details, yet\nanother reminder that he's just a human being. yet another reminder that\nhe's just a human being. - I mean, it's hard to keep your arm up for like hours. You can't let\nit down. If you keep it up, that's what it's all about, you know? keep it up, that's what\nit's all about, you know? - I mean, he was very much about the façade, right? It's very important to\npresent himself in a certain kind of way when he's giving the speeches. important to present himself in a certain\nkind of way when he's giving the speeches. - Yeah, it was, everything was orchestrated. The Nazis were masters\nin propaganda. They really knew how to create the perfect image. propaganda. They really knew how\nto create the perfect image. - Okay, so let's go into the cocktail. It\nstarted with the vitamins. This is in '36. vitamins. This is in '36. - Right. I think it was pretty\nharmless in the beginning. Mm-hmm. Just the addiction to the injection was the main thing that I think\nhappened, that Hitler needed his doctor. But from '36 to '41, only happened, that Hitler needed his doctor. But from '36 to\n'41, only like vitamins are being injected and glucose. vitamins are being injected and glucose, So I don't think it really harms you. I mean, it\nmight benefit you. He never got sick. He was fit. you. He never got sick. He was fit. - This, I mean, this is the thing that... That was\nphase one of his drug use, the vitamins, until '41. - That was phase one of his drug\nuse were the vitamins, until '41. - So, you think the tweaking at the Olympics, you've talked\nabout before but still, so you're saying this person- before but still, so\nyou're saying this person- ...we're watching a video of here, is not\non drugs. I don't know. I don't think so. - I don't know. I don't think so. - So the- the video could be faked. - There are no records. - It could be sped up. - I think it's fake, because I think\nsomeone read my book that Hitler was on, thought that Hitler was always on meth\nand created this. But I might be wrong. - Yeah, and the narrative takes hold, and I\nthink the thing you mentioned, he could be on sugar, so it could\nbe a lot of elements. - He was also a weird guy. Maybe\nhe was really just rocking... ...because he was so happy\nwith what he saw, you know? Maybe he really got into it. Maybe it was a\nsexual thing for him, what he saw. I don't know. There's no document showing that he took a\ndrug on that day, let's put it that way. - I think I've been, especially, like,\nstay up all night, I'll get fidgety. You can just be caught in a certain\nmoment when you're being very like... ...like fidgety. - I think he probably rocked a few times,\nand then the video was cut in a way... ...that he rocks more or something.\nAlso, methamphetamine wasn't yet available in 1936. So... - That's important to say. - ...for sure he was not.\nSo, what is said here, on Hitler tweaking on meth at the\n1936 Olympics, is definitely false. - Okay. There you go. So when\ndid it start getting more serious? The injection and the\nkind of drugs he was taking? - This was a day in August\nof 1941. Germany had invaded the Soviet Union on\nJune 22nd. So this is about six weeks into the campaign, which was called\nUnternehmen Barbarossa. And Germany was doing pretty well, and\nit came to a crucial moment where High Command\nsaid, \"Now we're going to take Moscow.\" And Hitler said,\n\"No, we're going to split up the troops and take\nLeningrad,\" which is now Saint Petersburg in the north, and in\nthe south, we're going to go for the, for the oil fields,\nbasically. That was his plan. He said, \"Let's not do Moscow.\"\nAnd High Command was like, \"This is the biggest\nmistake. We must take Moscow. If we, if we take Moscow, we're going to win.\"\nAnd Hitler became ill for the first time on the day this decision was made. I mean,\nthis is a dynamic thing that's going on, you know? They're moving, and now they have to\ndecide, \"Will we split up or will we continue towards Moscow?\" And he\nhad the Russian flu, in German, the Ruhr, which is a\nlike a flu-type disease with very high fever. It comes... Like, they were\nin the field, like so, they were in the east, you know, camping out.\nMaybe he drank water that wasn't good or he had some, you know, they\ntested everything meticulously, but he got, you know, he got sick.\nHigh fever, he felt like shit, and he said to Morell... And, you know,\nyou can see it in Morell's notes. Like Morell describes this very vividly\nin his notes, which are at the Federal Archives which no historian\never, ever looked at, except me, the non-historian,\nwhich is kind of funny. So, he describes how Hitler then asks of him, basically says, \"Vitamins are not\nenough anymore.\" Like he's very weak. He must, he must go to the military.\nBriefing, but the flu is quite a severe disease, I think. If you have a heavy\nflu, you really feel like you're going to die, you can't go to a\nmilitary briefing. But Morell kind of fought with himself, and\nthen he decided to inject an opioid into Hitler's veins intravenously, like\nthe strongest application possible. And this was Dolantine, which is a\nGerman opioid that was legal. And I was once an exchange student in Flint,\nMichigan, 1988, and I was number one of the tennis team because I was\nquite a good tennis player. We were playing our main\nenemy. I think I was at Flint Powers Catholic High School\nin Flint, Michigan, and I think it was Powers Central, and they\nhad a number one, Marc Resstiner. - Still remember, wow. - He was feared. And no one could beat him. - Yes. - And on the day of the match, I\nhad the Russian flu, basically. And I was the hope, I was the\nnumber one, the wonder kid from Germany. And they took me to a doctor, and the doctor gave me an injection. I\ndon't know until this day because I was a kid, I got the injection, I\nwas 17, and I felt great. The flu was gone like this.\nIt was probably an opioid, something that just shuts\noff all the pain and gives you energy. And I beat this guy. in a way I totally thought of a\nnew technique by playing very high balls. In the direct, fierceful\ncompetition, I would have lost, so I played something that in Germany we call \"Lüddeln,\"\nwhich is something you don't really do. You just play high balls. - Lobbying, yeah, yeah. - which is not pretty to look at,\nbut it's very effective. And he just lost his nerve, and\nI beat him like 6-0, 6-0, something like that.\nSensational. So Hitler receives this Dolantine injection, and he gets\nup, he goes into the meeting room, he dominates the\nmeeting room, he feels great. He decides, in front of everybody, no one\nis able to overpower him in that meeting. He was very good in the room.\nAnd the troops are split up. Leningrad is now a target. This weakens\nthe general thrust towards Moscow. This weakens the general\nthrust towards Moscow. This is probably why they didn't take\nMoscow. They probably could have taken it, or maybe not. But the\ndecision was made in August to- - I think it's one of the biggest\nblunders of the Eastern Front. - To not take Moscow. - To not take Moscow. I think they\nhad a straight shot given the- - Right - ...disorganization. - They had the one-time thing, the one-time\nmoment where they could have done it. And the German war machine\ncould only win in so-called speed wars like lightning war. Only\nif they would do it very fast and surprise, because they were always weaker,\nbasically. They just had this moment, this dynamic moment, and this was fueled\nby the methamphetamine. Also, in the Soviet Union, hundreds of millions\nof dosages were given, so the Germans were really going. And\nat one point, this ends, you know? You can't take meth for the rest of your\nlife. You're just going to end up being a nervous wreck. But you can do it for like\ntwo months. You could do it, but then it stops. - I think if you're really\nhonest about where you have the asymmetry of\npower, which is in the speed of the Blitzkrieg. So that's\nsimilar to Genghis Khan, who had a very small military, but their advantage was, I mean, I think at the peak\nit would be probably 100,000. And every soldier of Genghis\nKhan's had five horses. So the- - Right - ...the whole point was they can\nmove really fast. They, they, and they, not just fast, but they\ncan move on all terrain, so they can go around. You know, if wars were fought on\nnormal roads, you're supposed to travel a certain kind of way. If you go fast and\naround, not on paths that are usually taken, attack from all kinds\nof sides, that's why you can conquer as much as Genghis Khan was able to\nconquer. And the same thing with the Nazi forces, this is their biggest\nadvantage. And not using that is essentially the\nend of its effectiveness. - I think that's also why the\ntank troops were such a good weapon, because they can go off-road while military vehicles, cars,\ncannot do it. Like a tank can even go through a forest and just,\nyou know, kill small trees and just run over it. So those are kind of the five horses that was the idea\nthey had at this working breakfast. That's what they presented to Hitler.\n\"We're going to use the tank force in a very different way, and that's going to enable us to\nwin the lightning war of campaigns.\" - Was that one of the first times he tried\nan opiate like that? An intense one? - That was the first time. - And then that was it for him? He loved it? - Well, not immediately. You\ncan see when you study his medications, that\nthat is the turning point in a way, that now he deviates from the vitamins. He becomes more\ninterested in what's out there. And from '41 to '43, he tries out a lot of medications that he\ndidn't try out before. Before that, it was quite conventional,\nmostly vitamins and glucose. But now he becomes experimental,\nand he discusses this with Morell. And Morell is also\nvery experimental. They really nerded themselves into, like, \"What can we\nuse?\" Like, bull's testicle extracts. So, Morell, in order to present those\nthings to his patient A, he created a pharmaceutical company that he ran. So he was the personal\nphysician of Hitler, and he was also the CEO of Hammer\nPharmaceuticals, which had its production site in\noccupied Czechoslovakia. And for example, at one point, when Germany\nhad invaded the Ukraine, Morell asked for a monopoly for all the organs of\nall the slaughtered animals from all the slaughterhouses in the Ukraine.\nSo, this was a huge logistical operation. All the slaughtered\nanimals, all the organs were removed for the personal physician of the\nFührer, sent in military trains back to the factory in occupied\nCzechoslovakia. And the military became really upset with\nthat, because they said, \"We need our trains to transport back our\nwounded soldiers.\" Now there are cars full of offal and pigs' hearts and pigs' livers, and it was\ntotally bizarre. And Morell, but Morell then\nbecame, he was this good-natured Dr. Feelgood in the beginning,\nand then when the Ukraine was occupied, he became just like, a business freak\nwho made a lot of money with his dubious hormonal concoctions,\nwhere he would threaten the army. \"If you don't let the train with my raw materials go to\nmy factory, I will tell Hitler and you will have a\nproblem.\" He was acting like that. He became quite an\nasshole, actually. And a war criminal, because he also,\nat his factory where he would make the famous pig liver extract that was then tested by Hitler, and\nHitler said, \"That's a good medication. I feel more, I have more energy.\nSo, this can also be sold to the German military.\" That's how\nit worked, because the regulations at the time were, that it was\nvery difficult to bring out a new medication onto the market. Because\nmedications, to bring them onto the market, you need certain test phases\nand all of that stuff. So, that's hard to do in a war, especially\nin World War II. So, Hitler said to Morell, \"I'm going to be\nyour guinea pig. You just make it in your factory, I test\nit, and if I think it's good, then I'm just going to write\na...\" Today, you would say, like, a decree. \"Because I'm the President,\nyou know, I can order it that it's going to be legal all over Germany.\" - So, Hitler was a real\ndrug guy. He liked drugs. - Well, he liked to experiment, I\nwould say, with drugs and with Morell. They never... He was\nagainst drugs, you know? He was- - But that's a crazy thing for a guy\nwho didn't do anything, right? - It's a big contradiction, or it's\na big irony, or it's very weird. - But isn't it even a bit of\na mystery? Because, at that stage, I'm sure he was paranoid about being killed and all that kind of\nstuff. So, he must have really trusted Morell, right? - Yeah, he trusted Morell, because Morell\nwas not part of any organization. He was the loner coming from\nthe VIP doctors, his own VIP doctor's office, and now he was\nbasically Hitler's toy. Hitler could get access to all kinds of medications\nthrough him, and Morell would never say it to anybody, you know? He would\njust write it down. But this was kept quite secret. No one knew what\nwas going on between the two men. - See, it's just so interesting,\nbecause why would he? There might be... Can you maybe\neven speak to that? Why did Hitler trust another human\nbeing this much? Because you could probably make the case nobody\nwas closer to Hitler than Morell. - That is- that is certainly\nthe story I'm telling. - Isn't that crazy? Like, what\nis it about Morell? This guy who's... He's- I guess he's fat and weird,\nand, like, Nobody really likes him. - He was not a threat to\nHitler. Like, Hitler hated all the super smart medicine\npeople. Like, he didn't- he never undressed before them. He\nnever let himself be seen naked, 'cause he didn't want\nanyone to know anything, you know, about him that he couldn't\ncontrol. So, Morell was harmless. Morell would- basically did what Hitler\nwanted. They wouldn't say, \"We're gonna take- today we're gonna take drugs together.\nIt's gonna be fun.\" You know, Hitler was always about optimizing his performance,\nbecause he knew, \"Only I'm doing this. I have to...\"\nAnd he always thought he's gonna die young, so he always\nlike, \"I don't have unlimited time. The, the, the clock was\nalways ticking, so I have to be always the high performer.\" So\nHitler, when he first experienced the beauty of the opioid\nhigh that was given to him in August 1941\nintravenously, when he experienced that, kind of his eyes opened.\nAnd he didn't think this was a, drug. I mean, this is a medicine. This\nis a medicine that helps me function. This is a medicine that my doctor\ngives me in a very controlled manner, and that lets me be extremely sharp for, like, eight hours. I can convince\nall the generals. I can do my job. I'm happy. Because Hitler was also\ndepressed, you know? I mean, this is, uh... He need- he need... Like, he really appreciated what the drug gave him,\nbut he never thought, \"Now I'm becoming, like, a drug addict,\" or... - So it begins to, oxycodone in\ngeneral, begins to work within 30 to 60 minutes, and lasts for about four to\nsix hours. This is a long-lasting thing. - Yeah, but these are, this, this you swallow. If\nyou get an intravenous injection, it works after one second. - Wow. - Get the injection, you're high, but that- - But it lasts for many hours. - Yeah. That's why people love heroin,\nwho take it, because you feel like shit, you take the injection, you\nfeel great. I mean, it's in your system for quite a while. Like, you can\ngo into the meeting quite comfortably. - Into the meeting. Yeah, okay. - I mean, there's the briefing. It starts at\n1:00. Morell comes, and you can see this in the notes. Like, \"I have to\nbe at the Führer's bedroom at 12:00.\" And then, you know, you chat\na bit, and then Hitler rolls up his uniform sleeve, and then\nhe gets the injection maybe at maybe 12:30. Then the high\ncomes on, and then it's very stable. Like, you feel great. This is\na pure product from the Merck company. This is not some heroin from the\nstreet. And Morell knows exactly what dosage you want right now, so\nyou feel at the top of your game. You, you don't feel... You're not intoxicated. I mean, you are, but\nit makes you clear, you know? - So the mind is clear? - The mind's totally clear. Your\nbody feels fantastic. You know exactly your points. You know\nexactly how the others... 'Cause the others are just mortals, you know,\nbecause they're sober. They just sit there, and they just... They haven't slept very well,\nor they have problems with them, you know? with them, you know? And\nyou're, you're way above them. - What do we know about general psychological\neffects of it? So, does it boost your confidence? Does it boost aggressiveness?\nWhat effect did it have on his vision of the world? - It makes you feel extremely\nconfident. You have a lot of energy, energy, but it's not too much. Like, let's say\nyou take cocaine or methamphetamine, you're like- methamphetamine, you're like- That's why Hitler was never a meth guy.\nThat's also why I think this video is fake. He was... He didn't take meth.\nI mean, I studied Morell's, the things he gave him. He\ngave a lot of things, and only twice was meth. So that was... That's\nnot a lot for Hitler, like, twice. - I read that the multivitamin\nhad some amphetamine and maybe meth, a little bit, or no? - It's- - Multi- - I mean, I've s- - Vitamultin. - Vitamultine. - Multine. - I mean, Vitamultine is interesting\nbecause it was a little bar of a sweet that was lying next to his\nfood, so he would just, you know, eat. eat, and then at the end, he would\ntake this. It was nice-tasting. It had some sugar in it.\nAnd I read through all of the ingredients. There were different types,\nand never, there's never methamphetamine in it. and never, there's never\nmethamphetamine in it. - Oh, there isn't? Okay. - No. There was an SS, Dr.\nSchenck, and he claims that Morell made special Vitamultine in his lab\nwith meth in it, but I think he just made that up. made that up. - Okay. - There's... There was\nnever any proof of that. - I mean, that's a really\nimportant, like, line to draw. The, the army, the Nazi army, at scale, not everybody, but some fraction,\nespecially during the French campaign, used meth. French campaign, used meth. - Right. - And then there's Hitler,\nwhich used a lot of drugs, but meth was not one of them, really. - No, meth, for him, was just for\nthe foot soldiers, you know? I mean, he didn't even talk about meth. This\nis not nothing that concerned him, you know? This is something that makes you function. Maybe...\nHe signed... I mean, it went over his desk, it went over his desk,\nthe stimulant decree, but I don't know if he really read it or understood it. I\nmean, he probably knew Pervitin because everyone knew it. everyone knew it. And maybe,\nyou know, they discussed it, but they would probably also not...\nI mean, there was... Da- day there's a point when there's a conflict\nabout methamphetamine in the army. This is when the Secretary of Health\nof the German government, the Nazi government Conti, he starts writing to the army, and he says,\n\"You must stop this. This is against Nazi ideology.\" But the army\nbasically doesn't listen to him and keeps on using meth all\nthe way to the end. So maybe that guy, Conti, maybe he\ndiscussed this with Hitler, but... Also, Hitler never... You know,\nif Hitler would have said, \"We stop the methamphetamine,\" it probably would have\nstopped. But Conti saying that wasn't enough. I don't think Hitler was really\ninto meth. It was not his thing. He was more into the opioids, into these weird\nhormonal things. Those things were, especially the opioids, were interesting\nto him, because you can function on opioids for a long time\nif you have a proper product and a doctor that gives you the\ninjections. Göring was high on, was addicted to morphine from 1923 until\nwhen the Americans captured him in '45. That's 22 years he was functioning on\nmorphine. And when they captured him, he had... I write about it in\nBlitz, like the amount of morphine capsules he had on him.\nSo what the Americans did was first take away all the morphine from\nhim, and then he went through withdrawal in American, you know,\nincarceration. And he lost, you know, a lot of pounds,\nand he became more of a haggard Göring, which was\nthen in Nuremberg, you know, this haggard kind of guy\ndefending what he did. And so... Hitler was really\nan opioid guy, while the army was really meth-ed up. That's\nhow you could sum it up briefly. - He did try cocaine. Why didn't\nhe get into the cocaine? - He started cocaine after the bomb attack\nby Stauffenberg on July 20th, 1944. When this bomb went off, which actually\nkilled a few people in the room, this was during a military briefing. Stauffenberg\nput a bag with explosives under the table, and the table actually\nsaved Hitler's life because it was a good German quality oak table.\nSo the table was so stable that the bomb explosion kind\nof just, it blow up the table, but Hitler behind the table\nwas protected by this table. - Yeah, this is the closest\nassassination attempt, probably. - Yeah. I mean, it's very weird that it\ndidn't succeed because he had the bomb. He put it next to Hitler. He took\nout some of the explosives before he went into the room. This is one of\nthe big mysteries. Why did Stauffenberg take out some of the explosives?\nThere's no explanation for it. But Hitler survived, but he was\nquite injured, which Nazi propaganda always denied. They always said\nthe Führer was miraculously unharmed. But he was quite harmed. There\nwere over a hundred splinters from the wood everywhere. His eardrums\nwere blown, which was, you know, it's quite an injury, I guess. You\nknow, he was bleeding internally, and he was shell-shocked\nbasically. And then a new doctor comes in. His\nname is Keesing. Because Morell was not a... In\nGermany we have, well, I guess worldwide, it's the ear,\nnose and throat specialist, right? So an ear, nose and throat specialist\nfrom the German army called Dr. Keesing, he was ordered to come\ninto headquarters after the bomb attack to treat Hitler's\nblown eardrums. And Keesing gave Hitler cocaine, because cocaine at the time was being...\nYou know, it was used. It was not Schedule 1, you know. It\nwas... It had the effect that it would numb the pain, and you could use it, you would put it on a\ncertain place where you had the pain and then it\nwould numb that area. But Hitler had never taken cocaine before, but he got very interested in it. And\nKeesing writes a meticulous report about his experiences with Hitler. Alone,\nthat report is really fun to read. It's about a 15-page\nreport that he did for American military after the war.\nWhen he was being interrogated by American military, he described\nwhat happened with Hitler and him. And he realized that Hitler really\nliked the cocaine, and then he started saying, \"Now give it in\nthe nose now,\" and then it was a liquid that he could\napply with a dab into the nose. It wasn't cocaine powder, but he could- - It was liquified. Yeah, interesting. - Liquefied cocaine. And Hitler loved it, and\nhe's just saying things like, \"Finally, I can think clear again.\" He had\nthis cocaine rush, which is a rush of superiority. It's a\ndangerous drug because you think you know more than the\nother. It's not a very humble drug, you know. It just increases\nthe ego. And that actually he liked that because that was after the bomb attack, he thought everyone\nwas a traitor. He didn't feel safe anymore in his own bunker, you know.\nAnd he was like, \"Nazis...\" The right wing is always paranoid. \"Who's\nthe enemy? They're behind us. They're stabbing us in the back.\"\nHitler was this type of person. So the cocaine kind of\nstabilized him, and Keesing realized that this guy is a drug guy.\nHe didn't know. He came in, he saw the Führer for the first time. He\nwas in awe. And a drug wreck was approaching him. And as soon as he had some\ncocaine in his system—this was the summer of '44—he had already taken a lot of\nopioids and a lot of drugs. So he, and a lot of these dubious\nhormonal concoctions which led to autoimmune diseases in Hitler, maybe\nhe even had Parkinson's. He was Morell basically turned him into\na physical wreck. Keesing also writes about this, like he's trembling before\nhe goes into the room for the first time where the Führer is. And then there's like an old guy in a blue kind of\npajama, kind of coming up to him and shaking his hand.\n\"That's the Führer,\" you know. And Keesing is totally shocked\nbecause, you know, the destiny of the German nation, the\nwhole of Europe, everything is like- hangs on this guy, you know. And then\nwhenever he takes cocaine, he's a little bit better. But the\ncocaine had the problem that Keesing was more of a, at least later in his discussions with the\nU.S. military, he described himself as a conscientious guy. He's like, \"I became... I had problems\ngiving Hitler more cocaine.\" And- - Yeah, and I'm sure Hitler\ncould have sensed that. - And then Morell started\ndisliking Keeseing because Hitler spent more time with Keeseing\nthan with him. And there was this- this, what I call the\ndoctor's war ensued. 'Cause Keeseing then tried to get rid of\nMorell because Keeseing could suddenly see that Hitler was\nreceiving a lot of drugs. He was taking cocaine with Keeseing.\nKeeseing left the room. Then Morell would come in and\ngive him Eukodal opioid intravenously, which is\nthe speedball effect. Cocaine and an opioid, you\nknow, at the same time. That's like, that creates a really crazy\nhigh. But that's a high that's not stable anymore, you know. That's\na high that you... That's like at the end of your drug career.\nYou take the speedball. - So a speedball is a\ncombination of a stimulant- - Right - ... and a depressant. Cocaine and heroin. - Opioids are depressants. - Yeah. So combining cocaine\nand heroin, huh? Wow... Oh. - I've never had a speedball, but I think\nit's the most hardcore drug experience you can have, you know. And Hitler had\nthis in the summer of 1944 for quite some time. And then\nthe doctors really fought for influence over Hitler.\nAnd Keeseing teamed up with Himmler, head of the SS, and\nbasically said to Himmler, \"This Morell guy...\" And Himmler\nwas really suspicious of Morell obviously, because Morell was spending so\nmuch time with Hitler. There's no control. Himmler was a control freak. \"What is he actually\ngiving to the Führer? The Führer doesn't look good anymore.\" So Keeseing was\ntrying to get Morell out. Maybe because he wanted Hitler to have better health.\nMaybe he wanted to have the job himself. He certainly tried to get rid of\nMorell, and it came to like, a high noon situation, like the duel\nbetween the two doctors. It's, by the way, why I think it's\ncompletely insane that Hollywood hasn't bought the rights yet.\nAlone, this doctor's war. - You mean for the entire Blitz story or? - Yeah, of course. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's really... I mean,\nsome of the greatest movies... I mean, like, Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. - You can do a drug movie on the Nazis. - You know, one of my favorite movies,\nprobably Downfall, which is Hitler in the bunker, which does, I guess...\nDoes Downfall have a drug- - No. - ... component to that? - They missed the drug angle. Because my book\nhadn't been out yet, they didn't know about it. That's why they can't- - That'd be a different story. - They can't really explain\nwhy Hitler became a physical wreck. There's no explanation\nfor it except the drugs. - Well- - The opioid addiction. - You could explain it.\nIt is a part of it that you're... It's just an extremely\nstressful position he's in. - Yeah, but you don't become a\nphysical wreck if you're... - And he's losing the war. The\nphysical wreck aspect, yeah. - And there were two bedrooms in the\nbunker in Berlin. Two bedrooms. One, of course, for Hitler,\nthe other one for Morell. No one else was sleeping in the\nbunker. I mean, you can see the importance of, especially\nin those last months, of Morell in the bunker. And they\ndidn't get that when they made the movie, The Downfall.\nBut it's still an interesting movie, but I can't take it seriously\nbecause they didn't see this as a... - As a drug component. - It's missing. - Again, I don't think it has to be the main thing, but it has to be\na part of it. A serious movie on Blitzed would be really\nnice. It's not easy to do. - No. - There's something about drugs,\nif you do a movie on drugs, that involve drugs, that\nit makes it... You can go too far into like\nTarantino territory... - Right - ...where it's more like... which is\nalso incredible and awesome, but it's a different thing. - Well, he invents history,\nand he's very open about it. - Yeah. - Like, this is not what actually\nhappened. I think a Blitzed movie would have to stick to the facts.\nAnd I've spoken with some directors, very good German directors, and\nit's just very hard to do. But... - But if you do it well,\nthat's a legendary movie. - I think it would be. Yeah. Yeah. - Yeah, that would be incredible.\nCan you just speak high level from, from... What is it? You\nsaid '41 to '45. What were some behavioral changes or changes in\ndecision making that we can trace in Hitler that could be attributed to\ndrugs? Like, how did they change him? - Well, an interesting event is\nJuly 1943 in a villa in Northern Italy where Hitler meets\nMussolini. And Mussolini is basically fed up with the war, and\nhe wants Italy to leave the Axis of Evil. And Hitler is really\npissed when he hears that. He knows that's what the\nmeeting is all about. And Mussolini, I mean, the Italians\ninvented that modern type of fascism. And they were all...\nItaly was the role model for Nazi Germany, but by now, Nazi\nGermany, of course, has been much more powerful. But, you know,\nItaly is the most important ally. And now Mussolini is like quitting\nin the middle of the war. I mean, what is going on here? So Hitler\nbecomes... And Morell writes about this quite a lot. He's in a terrible\nmood. He really... he doesn't want to go. Like, he might\nlose his, you know, temper or whatever. He's not happy. And\nthat's actually, that's the day when he receives the Eukodal for the\nfirst time. And he... Because he says under such stress, I'm not gonna\ngo.\" He threatens, like he calls off the whole thing. The plane's\nalready waiting in Obersalzberg. Everything is ready, and he says,\n\"I'm not meeting this guy.\" And then Morell gives him Eukodal,\nand you can see, you know, the time when he gets the Eukodal. And\nthat's when he has this effect for the first time, this like, \"I can\ndo anything. This is great. I'm gonna, I'm gonna explain to Mussolini\nthat he's not gonna leave the war effort.\" And on the way to\nthe plane, he says to Morell that this Eukodal is\nreally helping him, and he wants another shot, and he\nreceives another shot. So he has quite a lot of Eukodal in him when\nhe speaks to Mussolini. And there's like the people who write the protocol of the meeting, and also other people around.\nIt's not just two people in the room. It's like, I don't know, 15 or\n20 people in the room. And a lot of people talk about that\nmeeting in their memoirs. And Mussolini is not able to say one\nword basically, because Hitler is so high and so charged, and he's\njust telling the whole time how great this is, you know, what they're\ndoing right now. And of course, it's not even possible that you're gonna\nleave, you know. We are in this together from... you know, he explains\neverything, the whole thing, for like two hours, and Mussolini is just like, is\nlike... Then a messenger comes in and says, \"Rome has just been bombed.\"\nHe's like, and he's like he knows, but he can't say\nanything and he stays, you know. So that was very much influenced,\nthat meeting, by his Eukodal. And that's probably because it\nwas so successful in Hitler's eyes, what happened, is why Eukodal became\na very attractive drug for him. And this happened, this was the\nfirst time in July 1943. And then, so it didn't take Eukodal through the whole\ntime. You know, it only started in July 1943, he started with\nregular opioid use. You can see that he takes it more and more\nregularly now. Not every day, but sometimes, like there's a\nSeptember 1944, he takes Eukodal every second day, which is like\na junkie rhythm. You take it, and the next day, you don't take\nit. Then you take it again. - Why is that junkie rhythm? - You don't take it all the\ntime because you need to, I don't know, relax or, you don't, there's like, you take it maybe\nSaturday night, you take it, and the high lasts till Sunday\nmorning. And then Sunday when the high slowly wears off, you sleep,\nand then you wake up, and you're hungry. Maybe you eat. And then the next\nday, Monday, you're gonna do it again. So that's, that's this rhythm. - And it was more potent\nthan what is it, Dolantin? - Dolantine. - Do- Dolan- - Eukodal is said to have the\nbest effect, the best in the... In the sense of it's not about strength, you\nknow, you just increase the dosage and you have a stronger effect, but you can't increase it too\nmuch because then you're gonna die, you know. That's also the problem with opioids. If\nyou take too much, you're going to die, 'cause you're just gonna have\na heart attack. So but... - There's nuance differences that... ...it's hard to convert\ninto words, I guess. Yeah. - Different molecules have different effects.\nSo Eukodal apparently had the best effect. That's why they had the oxycodone epidemic in America, because\npeople take this pill, I mean, thank God they're not injecting it all\nlike Hitler did. They take a pill, so it's not as dangerous as injecting.\nBut apparently the effect is so pleasant of this Eukodal, of this\nparticular type of opioid, that it just is more attractive maybe than Dolantin. - Is it possible to try to reverse engineer the effect of Hitler's drug use\non the outcome of World War II? So if he didn't use any drugs, would\nthe Nazis been more successful or less successful? What do you think? - I think it would be speculative\nto answer, but I can try. Uh, but it's very the war\nis so complex. I mean, there's many different ways this war\ncould have played out and ended, but I think it would always have\nended with a German defeat. - I don't think it would have\nended with a German defeat. - Well, if you don't attack the Soviet\nUnion, then of course you can win. But as soon as you attack\nthe Soviet Union... - As we talked about, I think the\nprobability of success is low. But, you know, I would put it\nlike, I don't know, 10%. Again... - Right - ...extremely speculative. But\nif you do Blitzkrieg type of attack, very rapid, don't\nsplit the forces in Operation Barbarossa, go straight for Moscow. Don't\ninvade Britain. Don't declare war on the United States, and really focus\non gaining oil from the Middle East. So maybe making the Africa\ncampaign the central point in the very beginning so that you have the resources\nthat are essential for the industrial capacity of Germany that's required\nto, you know, keep manufacturing and keep fueling the planes, the tanks,\nthe mechanized aspect of the army. So there's a lot of paths to\nthis. I mean, but I don't think, I think it's probably fair to\nsay that reasonable, thoughtful, calculated, disciplined leader would not have done any of the\nthings Hitler did, even in the beginning. I mean, it requires insanity,\nit requires hatred, it requires ideological self-capture where\nyou tell yourself narratives that rapidly deviate from like ground\ntruth, from first principles of things. And you're just an insane\nperson. You're an insane dictator that's drunk on power. And it's\nimpossible for you to make great military decisions at that point. - Yeah, you would need like an impossible\nHitler that is as crazy as he was, but still wouldn't make any... - Mistakes - ...irrational mistakes. So that\ndoesn't exist. Hitler can only be imagined or understood as this, this,\nthis, in a way, as the drugs. Hitler without drugs is unthinkable\nfor me. And it, it doesn't, it makes, he was the drug guy. You cannot,\nyou cannot separate this. So Hitler was a self-destructive personality,\nand National Socialism is a self-destructive movement. That's why I\nsaid I think the Germans would have lost in any case. You know, except\nif there was this, this perfect Hitler, which is\ntheoretically impossible. - Theoretically possible in the 20th\ncentury. I mean, you could think of a Genghis Khan or Alexander the\nGreat type characters that would really internalize the sense of, in\nthe case of Hitler, that the German people are, like without the hatred,\nwithout the ideology, but with the murderous with the ability to dehumanize the rest of the world\nand see the German people as, uh- - Superior - ...the superior, and so it's\nfair to do the Lebensraum and all of that kind of stuff. - Right. - It's hard to, it's just, the reason you want to think about that\nkind of stuff is Hitler got, to me at least, close to capturing a very large\npart of the world. And it's inc- it's, it's terrifying\nand sort of unbelievable that somebody could get close to that. - I mean, what you described as this\nfeeling of superiority and conquering countries, that was basically what the Wehrmacht,\nthe high command, that's what they were going for. And they wanted to eliminate\nHitler in the Operation Valkyrie, not because they\nthought, \"He's an evil guy, he's killing the Jews,\" or, you know, they\nwanted to eliminate him because he was not this effective decision-maker\nanymore that they needed to win the war, or to end it in a different way. And\nI spoke with Anthony Beevor once about the attempt of British intelligence\nto assassinate Hitler, and he had seen some evidence\nthat at the point in time, they dropped those\nplans because they knew that drugged Hitler or\nmalfunctioning Hitler, which he was after, you know, the summer of 1943, is better for Britain than, you\nknow, killing Hitler and then having to deal with, like, some kind of, you\nknow, maybe the army would have taken over the country, and that would have been more\nuncomfortable for Great Britain than having the continuation of the\ndegenerating maniac. - What do we know about the very\nend, Hitler in the bunker? The moments, the days, the weeks,\nthe months leading up to the suicide, all those kinds of things? - It's quite well-documented\nbecause people at the time were keeping diaries and writing about\nit, writing about their experiences. Also, Morell wrote quite a bit\nwhat happened in the bunker. Um, one thing that changed was that Eukodal was\nnot available anymore, so the drug that Hitler actually had become\nphysically addicted to was suddenly not available anymore.\nThis had to do with the bombardment of the Merck company, the\nfactory in December 1944. British bombers destroyed the\nproduction facilities. And Morell, there's a\nreport of Morell, the overweight person riding on a motorcycle\nthrough bombed out Berlin from pharmacy to pharmacy, basically going into the\npharmacies trying to score Eukodal, and he couldn't find it anymore. It was\nnowhere to be found, and that's when Hitler goes into withdrawal. What\nI find surprising is that he didn't use another opioid because morphine\nwas available all the way till the end, but he never kind of made\nthat switch then. Like, he doesn't... Also, he didn't realize\nfor a long time that he becomes physically dependent on a\ndrug, that he becomes a drug addict, but this realization\nhappens in the last weeks in the bunker because\nGoebbels, he understood it, and Goebbels wanted that bedroom, the\nsecond bedroom. So he said to Hitler, \"Do you understand what's going\non, that Morell turns you into a drug addict?\" And\nHitler's like, and at one point he realized what Goebbels\nis saying is true because he felt the withdrawal, he was shaking\nand he felt like shit, and- and Morell is, like, giving him weird stuff in the end.\nLike, one time he gives him harmine, which is an MAO inhibitor, which is part of ayahuasca actually\nbecause he still had that in his doctor's bag. It hadn't been used yet, so\nhe gives him that, which also creates some kind of a weird high, but, you know, Hitler at one point realizes really\nwhat's going on. This is late April, so very late in the\ngame, and there's a few reports of what actually happens,\nlike some say that Morell has to kneel in front of him and that\nHitler puts a gun on his head and says, \"You've been making me addicted\nto opioids. Get the hell out of the bunker.\" For sure\nhe fires him that day, and then Morell's described as being in tears, like, leaving the bunker, he\ngets one of the last planes out of Berlin. He has a research lab\nin the south of Bavaria close to the Berghof, and he makes one of the last\nor the last plane out of Berlin. - He survives? - Yeah. And he goes to this research\nlab, and this is like May 2nd, 1945. He has like a little\napartment in this research lab. His wife is still in Berlin. He's\nall alone, and he starts doing his taxes, and that kind of shows you that he was\nprobably insane at that point, you know? - Just totally out of touch. - Why would you do your tax... Maybe he was\nbored, you know, maybe he didn't do his taxes for so long because he always had to treat Hitler\nand then he thinks like, \"Now what am I gonna do? I'm just gonna do my taxes\nnow.\" Very German thing to do. - He's just a strange character. I\nmean, you tell this whole story... - I would put that in the movie for\nsure, him doing his taxes and... - That's how the movie ends. - Well, then the Americans move into\nBavaria, liberate Bavaria from national socialism, which was a great\njob they did there, and so I'm also thankful not only to the\nRed Army but also to the American forces. Really very thankful that they... Because national socialism\nwas hard to beat. It was a beast, you know? It was hard to beat.\nSo they capture Morell. and they interrogate him, and he actually lives\nfor another two years in American custody in Germany, in a military\nprison. And after these two years, his health's really bad.\nHe has heart problems and, the Americans dump him\nin front of the Munich train station in a much\ntoo small kind of uniform jacket, like probably an American\nuniform, and he's lying on the pavement in front of the train\nstation. And a half-Jewish nurse that walks around there, finds him, and she\nsays, \"I'm Theo Morell.\" It's like, it's really like in a movie. \"I'm Theo\nMorell. I was the personal physician of the Führer.\" She's like, \"This is\n1947. Germany's in ruins.\" And she brings him to a hospital. His\nwife comes from Berlin for the last time. They meet in a hospital\nat Tegernsee, beautiful lake in Bavaria, and then he dies. So\nthat was the end of Morell. So we know pretty much\nwhat happens in the end. - ...did somebody try to talk to Hitler\nabout this? Like, what about Eva Braun? Has anybody close to him\ntried to talk about- - Well, Goebbels did. - Well, that at the very end. But\nyou would imagine maybe the the generals, or friends, or inner circle.\nI mean, that, the reason I mentioned Eva is because, you know, like, personal,\nand people close to him. - There is a certain tension between Eva\nBraun and Morell. And I could very well imagine that she talked with Hitler about\nit, but there's no record, so I don't know exactly. But they had a very intimate relationship. So Eva Braun was\nnot just the dumb blonde that plays no role. They actually spoke\nevery day. And when Hitler was in the military headquarters, he would phone\nher every night at 10:00 PM. They would have a long phone conversation.\nSo they had a very deep relationship, and I'm pretty\nsure she didn't really like Morell because, you know, for the\nobvious reasons. He was closer to Hitler than herself. And, you know, if you count one plus one,\nit's two, you know. So- - But she could have maybe not liked him because\nshe might have cared for Hitler. And you can see the effects of drugs\non humans that you care for. - She also had a good relationship with him\nat times. Because he was often at the Berghof. The Berghof was like the,\nwhat is it called? Mar-a-Lago. Um- - Oh, the Mar-a-Lago? Yeah. - Yeah, that was kind of\nwhat it was. And it was actually, it became an official\nheadquarters for Hitler so he would actually make decisions from there.\nIt was not just a vacation place. And Morell was often there, and Eva\nBraun was always there. That was her place. She was running that place.\nShe was like the woman of that place. And Hitler was often, of course,\nin the field in the headquarters, but he came as much as he could to\nthe Berghof because it's quite beautiful. I went up there.\nIt's quite interesting. And she also had a good relationship\nwith Morell, and there's like a paper that I found where like they were very intimate and very close. Like,\nthere's a paper of Morell where she comes to him in the\nmorning and she has scratch marks. So apparently,\nthey had violent sex. So Morell is also kind of\na witness to that, that that I found in Washington,\nDC in the National Archive. - Wait, Hitler and Eva had violent sex?\nWhat do we know about Hitler's sex life? It's like not known, right? - I found it interesting that Morell\ndescribes these scratch marks. I mean, it's interesting. So\nthey had some kind of kinky sex maybe. Maybe they also had normal\nsex and sometimes it was kinky, or- Maybe Hitler was aggressive\nin bed, but it doesn't really matter. It's just what\nhappened between Eva and him. - Yeah, I don't think that affected-\n...military operations of the Wehrmacht. - The drug use did. His sex... If\nhe would have had sex with a lot of people, maybe with his\ngenerals, maybe then, you know, it would be worth writing about it because maybe he\ndominated these generals in bed or something. But he was just having sex with\nEva, and I don't think that's historically relevant. It might\nbe interesting for the movie, but Also, I don't want to\nsee Hitler having sex. - I don't think anyone wants\nto see Hitler having sex. - But Eva Braun is an interesting\ncharacter because she had more of a say than historians for a long\ntime attributed to her. Then a biography was written on her by a female\nGerman historian, and that's a very good biography. It really shows that\nshe had, you know, quite a lot to say in this relationship. She\nwas not the dumb blonde that just... She was quite opinionated and\nactive. And she was filming him a lot. She was always filming\nin the Berghof. You can go online and look at the Eva Braun\nclips, and you will see Hitler in color at the Berghof, how he's meeting\nchildren, petting their head. And she was contributing to the myth of\nthis private, the good private man. So Eva Braun is an interesting\ncharacter for sure. But I found one note that she, in the\nbeginning when Morell started with his drugs, said to Morell that she wants the same medications, not drugs,\nthe same medications as Hitler so she would be on the same\nwavelength with him. She wanted to be... She didn't want\nto lose this world. But, Hitler became such a drug\npolytoxicomanic user that, of course, Eva couldn't keep up with that.\nThey weren't a drug couple. I didn't see any evidence for that, that they would take all\nthe crazy drugs together and then have crazy sex or something like that. That's\nnot how it was. So I think she was sympathetic to Morell in the beginning and then changed her opinion.\nAnd I'm pretty sure she talked with Hitler about it, but there's no\nrecords about their private conversations. - Let's talk about another perspective on\nthis whole story that you document in your book, 'The Bohemians.' The subtitle\nis, 'The Lovers Who Led Germany's Resistance Against the\nNazis. So this is the story of the people who resisted\nfrom within Germany. - Right. - Can you tell their story? In particular,\nlet's talk through the story of the two key figures in the movement\nwho-- ...happened to also be in love. - Well, the main guy is\nHarro Schulze-Boysen. He caught my attention when I was\ndoing research in an archive in Munich, researching drugs in the Luftwaffe, Göring's Luftwaffe.\nGöring being the more, I mean, the Luftwaffe was a drug... very promiscuous place. A lot of\npeople in the Luftwaffe were high. - Oh, so more for entertainment\nversus the practical aspect? So it's less about the meth\noptimizing human performance and more about just exploring? - Like the number three of the\nLuftwaffe, Ernst Udet, he committed suicide in the fall of 1941. He had had\nseven Pervitin tablets for breakfast. - Okay. - So he was really high on\nmeth. He really enjoyed it. But he loved to take meth and then drink.\nAlcohol was a big thing in the Luftwaffe. You can drink a lot more when\nyou're on methamphetamine. And I found this letter,\nand that was really a coincidence, while I was\nlooking through the drug stuff. I was searching for drugs, and\nI found this letter by Harro Schulze-Boysen, who had\nnothing to do with drugs, but still, I found this letter. I\ndon't know why, I can't remember how exactly it happened that I was suddenly\nreading this letter, and it was the last letter that he wrote in\nhis life. He wrote it to his father, and he said that,\n\"Everything I have done, I'm totally fine with it, and\nI know it's very hard for you, and I really am mostly sad for\nyou and mother and my brother, that you have to go through this. I'm\nvery sorry, but I'm fine with it, and I have a clean conscience.\nI did what I could to stop this madness.\" And I'm like, \"What? Who is this guy?\"\nI googled him, and there were not so many hits on I googled him, and there\nwere not so many hits on him, but I read a little bit, and he\nactually had formed together with his wife, Libertas, which means freedom-- - Good name. - He had formed the largest\nresistance network against the Nazis that ever existed.\nOver 100 people in Berlin that were all connected, and they were, they were\nlike from all flights of life. Like, there were some\nartists, others were workers. Some were leftists, others\nwere patriots. Harro always believed that people\ncould come to an agreement, like it's possible to\nactually talk about things, and he was a, he was a\ntrue democrat, maybe you could say, or a true,\nI don't know, libertarian. He had to learn a hard lesson\nthat with Nazis, you cannot argue, because they, they are\nalways right. They're not... It doesn't work. At least it didn't work\nduring the Third Reich. He had published a newspaper during the Weimar\nRepublic called Gegner, which means opponent. And in the Gegner, opponents could all write. Whoever were the street's\nopponents, they could all write in The Opponent. And so you read all kinds of texts and opinions, and he\nthought when Hitler took over power in '33 that he could continue\nto publish The Opponent, because he thought even in a Nazi-led\nGermany, you know, this keeps the discourse. You have to\nhave a discourse. We have to discuss. We have to disagree, you\nknow. And then in April 1933, two months after Hitler took power, they had a meeting with the\neditorial staff. They discussed the new issue, and then there was a\nknock on the door. It was the SS, and they beat up everybody\nand they destroyed the typewriters and the printing press that\nthey had in the office in Berlin. They took Harro and his best\nfriend, who was half Jewish, to one of these early\nconcentration camps, and they tortured both of them,\nand the Jew was killed. He didn't make it. Henry\nErlanger and Harro, at that moment, he realized who he was\nagainst. He realized that he has to... He decided to become... to fight the system. And the way he\nfought the system was later during the '60s. We\nalso had a '60s cultural and political changes in\nGermany. And then our '60s, they called it \"March\nthrough the Institutions.\" That is a way to infiltrate\nthe system, to become part of the system, and\nthen, you know, change the system from within. So you\ndon't leave the country, you stay, you go into the institutions.\nYou march through the institutions. So Harro\ndecided to go into the Luftwaffe, and he was working\nin the Luftwaffe Ministry, a huge building still intact today in Berlin Wilhelmstrasse. Quite an interesting\nbuilding that was like the power center of the Luftwaffe, or\nlike one of the most important structures in the whole Nazi regime. And he\nwas working there, and he worked his way up, and he received quite a lot of information. For example, when\nGermany, for the first time, became militarily active again.\nThis was in 1936, when the Germans supported the fascists\nin Spain in the Spanish Civil War. This was a clandestine\noperation. The Luftwaffe did this, and German soldiers went\nto Spain like in plain clothes, posing as vacationers. But then they, you\nknow, were actually soldiers and supporting vacationers. But then they, you know,\nwere actually soldiers and supporting Franco's... You know, were part of Franco's\nvictory later on. And Harro had this information, and he tried to pass this on\nto the BBC. He failed passing it on. He met a BBC journalist during\nthe Olympic Games in Berlin, and told him about this, and the BBC\nguy was too afraid to make this public, and he kind of buried that information. So Harro is just a very\ninteresting character, and he was in love with Libertas, and\nLibertas with him. Harro came from Libertas with him. Harro came from like\na bourgeois family, very educated. very educated. His great granduncle was\nvon Tirpitz, who built up the marine, von Tirpitz, who built up the\nmarine, the Navy for the Kaiser. So he came from this influential German\nfamily, but they were all patriots. They were not Nazis. They were\ndemocrats, patriots, and militarists, patriots, and militarists, I\nguess you could say, or even, you know, very straight-laced\nalso. And Libertas, she came from And Libertas, she came from a castle\nnorth of Berlin. She was this bohemian, like aristocratic Bohemian\ntype. She's very good-looking, always playing music. And they fell in\nlove. They met on the Wannsee on boats. love. They met on the Wannsee\non boats. They were both on... Harro was rowing, and she was on a\nsailboat of a guy that Harro also knew. So he was rowing and he saw his friend\non the sailboat. He looked at Libertas, on the sailboat. He looked at Libertas,\nshe looked at him, and they were in love in love in 1934. And the other guy, the friend of Harro, he\nleft his sailboat, because he realized, \"I'm like the fifth wheel on the\ncar, not really needed,\" right? \"not really needed,\" right? How do\nyou say that in sailboat terms? I don't know, the third\nsail is not needed. But what happened at night, Harro didn't\nsleep with Libertas. For her, that was sleep with Libertas. For her, that was\nvery unusual because everyone wanted very unusual because everyone wanted to\nsleep with her, but Harro wanted to keep his clothes on, and it was a very warm\nnight. I researched this quite thoroughly. I know exactly the temperature. So\nalso, when you read The Bohemians, when you read The Bohemians, you really\nexperience the life of these people, what they experienced, but everything\nis nothing is invented, which is is nothing is invented, which is very\ntricky to do. So what happens that night, tricky to do. So what happens that night,\nLibertas wants to take off his clothes, Libertas wants to take off his clothes,\nand he doesn't want to take them off. Why? From the torture in April\n1933, he has quite a lot of scars. he has quite a lot of scars. They even\nburned swastikas into his thighs. burned swastikas into his thighs.\nLike, not burned, sorry, with knives. the SS. So he doesn't want to show that\nto her. He hadn't had a girlfriend to her. He hadn't had a girlfriend\nfor a while. He can't open up emotionally, because he's fighting the\nNazis. It's very secret. No one knows about this, that he's long-term\nplanning his life to fight the system that he hates so much because they killed\nhis best friend in front of his eyes. But at one point, Libertas does, you\nknow, take off his clothes and she sees this, and she's naive. She's even a member\nof the Nazi party, but she's not a very of the Nazi party, but she's not a very\nactive party member. She just, you know, she works for MGM actually in Berlin. A\nHollywood film studio office in Berlin, A Hollywood film studio office in Berlin,\nGermany was one of the biggest movie markets, and she was the press girl.\nShe did the campaigns for the big Hollywood movies in Germany. - So just a regular German girl? - Well, she wasn't regular. She was from a\nvery high family. Actually, her grandfather had been in a relationship\nwith the German. emperor, which is a side story that I\nfound out when I researched The Bohemians. The German emperor apparently was bisexual and was going to\nthat castle, and they had homosexual kind of meetings there\nwith Libertas' grandfather. So she came from a very...\n...Unusual family. - Yeah. But what I mean by\na usual German girl... What I mean by that is it's not\nobvious that a person like that would hold a crucial role in the\nresistance against the Nazis. - No, not at all. That was always a\nproblem because for her, it was weird that someone was\nagainst the system. But Harro told me... Harro was totally\nconvinced that fascism is wrong and that he has to fight it. More and more Libertas was\nconvinced, and then more friends came into the group. And the way Harro\norganized this resistance group was through parties. They were like a power\ncouple of Berlin, and they had a great loft apartment. They moved\ntogether to a loft apartment on also a side street from Ku'damm, a huge room, and there they had parties every\nsecond Thursday night, and they would invite friends. Then once they trusted\nsomeone personally, then they would spill the beans and say,\n\"This is actually not just a party.\" But they would test\nit. At the party, they would say something critical of the regime,\nand you immediately, you know, either the person jumps\non it, responds, or you know, goes somewhere else, gets\na drink at the bar. Not into it. So that was the way of\nrecruiting people, and that was such an efficient way that\nthe Gestapo was not able to understand this group for a long time,\nnot even recognize that there's a group, because Gestapo was very\ngood at infiltrating, for example, communist resistance groups,\nbecause you just had to go in as a Gestapo guy and be a communist. Just say the right words and they\nwould, at one point, you know, take you. But with Harro and Libertas,\nit wasn't so easy, you know. They would sniff you out. - These parties were what, like intellectuals?\nLike artists and that kind of stuff? - Yeah, yeah. They had music, they\nwould dance, they would sleep with each other. They also... - Oh, sex stuff too. - Well, they had... and this is, again,\nkind of a parallel to the '60s. They had the idea that if you're\nagainst fascism, if you're for freedom of everything... - Yeah, free love, the whole thing. - ...yeah, they had free love, but\nit wasn't a dogma. There was also a female doctor there. She was quite\nsquare, I guess you would say. square, I guess you would say, and she was,\nlike, against this and she said, \"This is too complicated. We are a\nresistance group, like, what if there's jealousy and what...\"\nThis could compromise operations. And it did sometimes. That's why The\nBohemians are a very interesting subject, because sometimes it just doesn't work.\nIn a way it works that love really bonds them together. But also especially Libertas and Harro,\nthey have a terrible marriage sometimes. They really fight, because\nLibertas is not so much intellectually convinced. She's more\nof a resistance fighter from the heart, like, she feels that the Nazis\nare not good, but Harro is more like the analytical guy. So they have a lot\nof friction also, and it's a... It's a fascinating story. And\nthey came quite far. They made... There was a point in time when Harro\nhad militarily relevant information through his position at the Luftwaffe\nministry, and he passed that on to allies, to Western allies\nand to the Soviet Union. So he went a step further\nthan just being a resistance group. He became,\nyou could say, a traitor, or... - He would give information to the Soviets. - Yeah, he would, because he said, - As part of the resistance. - Yeah, they can beat Germany. But that\nwas also discussed in the groups. Very interesting to see, like, some say,\n\"We can't do this 'cause the Soviet Union's also a totalitarian\nregime.\" But then Harro says, \"Yeah, but they are going\nto beat Hitler.\" So, it's... The Bohemians is a very interesting topic. - What lessons do you learn\nfrom these folks, maybe about why so few resisted\nHitler while in Germany? - I mean, it was extremely dangerous. - It's purely the danger? Is\nit also people believed it's hard to take yourself,\nlike, be an independent thinker and take yourself outside the\npropaganda? 'Cause they're also swimming in propaganda. - I mean, the chances of\nsucceeding are quite small, 'cause the system\nwas extremely strong. And if you made a joke about Hitler and\nthe wrong person heard it, like, in a restaurant and would rat on you, you would land in a concentration\ncamp. So, people were very, very careful. Also, at parties,\nwith how Libertas was singing and they were drinking and dancing, and then\nsuddenly the political discussion started, that's... You know you have to\nhave guts to then actually not leave the party but to stay, because\nthey were rising their lives, basically. As soon as they would be found\nout, they would be dead. And people don't want to die when they're\nin their mid-20s. They were pretty young. And Libertas would often\nsay, like, \"We can't win. You know, why are\nwe risking our lives for what, you know?\" So,\none time they did a... Gelbe Sättel Aktion,\nGelbe Sättel. Like, they produced... 'cause one guy had\naccess to a printing press, and they produced leaflets, like, small papers that\nhad glue on one side, and the paper said, what the Nazis did, they set up a huge exhibition hall, which was\ncalled the Soviet Paradise, and And this exhibition always in the center of\nBerlin. I'd never heard about this before. I found this when I researched the\nBohemians, and it was the most popular exhibition during the\nwhole of the, of the war. Like, two million people, two\nmillion Germans saw this. They went into this exhibition, and\nthey saw how horrible the Soviet Union is, how horrible communism is\nto people. So, it was a propaganda show. And the group decided\nto make these leaflets which didn't say \"The Soviet\nParadise,\" but it said \"The Nazi Paradise,\" torture, SS torture,\nhunger, war, how long will it last? And they glued\nover a thousand of these stickers everywhere in Berlin in May 1942, at night, and they organized it\nin a way that they, always two, a man and a woman would go out, and they had,\nlike, the stickers with them, and then they would pretend to kiss and would, like,\nlean on a wall. And then while they were kissing, one would, like, put the\nsticker on. Then they would move on in the dark. So, in the\nmorning of that May 1942, tens of thousands of Berliners\nsaw that the city was, like, saw these things. So, does it make a difference? It made one on\nthat day, you know? It was a very dangerous thing to do,\nand no one was, no one got caught. And in the morning, a lot of\npeople saw that there is actually resistance, that there are people\nwho do something against it. So, I think they did something. - Yeah, I was reading about\nprotests in recent human history, and most of them, many of them, don't have an effect\nuntil they do. It's like this threshold effect. It's very hard to know. It's very hard to know because it's,\nit's a match that lights a fire. And sometimes the spark, it\ntakes a little bit of time to propagate through the whispers.\nWhat happens is the people whispering, it's the whisper network\nof people talking, and sometimes it just takes that one sticker\nto begin the whispers, and then a few months later, the\nregime is overthrown. It's funny. But it's hard to sort of trace back\nwhat was effective and what was not. - I mean, Harro was convinced\nthat the system would lose, so he thought that maybe we can\nmake a contribution that it's going faster. Maybe we\nwill be that spark. So- Unless, when I think that\nthere's this possibility, I must try it, you know? That's, that was\nhis conviction. So, he would put his life on the line for that possibility. - How did they get caught? - They were approached by the Soviet Union,\nwho wanted to recruit them as spies. And they didn't want to do\nthat. Harro refused the Soviet intelligence. These are\ndocuments that were found in the early '90s. One of\nthe sons of one of the members of that group of Harro's, a\ngood friend of Harro, one of his sons went to Moscow to look at the\nfiles, and he found a kind of furious Soviet KGB kind of descriptions of this weird guy, Harro, that doesn't\nwant to be a proper Soviet spy and just says, \"Yes, I'm going to give you information\nso you can hurt Hitler, but I'm not going to play your game. I'm not\ngoing to be one of you.\" So, still they did collaborate with\nthe Soviet Union. They accepted a radio transmitter from\nthe Soviet Union with, with which they were supposed to send\nmilitary information via radio to Moscow, and they struggle with the\ntechnology. The Russians give them, like, an apparatus only with\na Russian instruction, and it's, like, very difficult. They make mistakes.\nBut what actually then gets them caught is the Russians\nat one point answer and send a message to them through the\nether, and that message is decoded. But the Nazis intercept that\nmessage and are able to decode it. And in the message,\nit gives the clear names of Harro and his address, which is\na total intelligence blunder. Or maybe they just wanted to give them\nup, and had their revenge because Stalin did crazy stuff\nlike that, you know? So they suddenly know, the Gestapo\nknows Harro Schulze-Boysen, the high-ranking officer in the Luftwaffe\nministry is giving military information to the Soviet Union, and apparently, he's meeting with all\nkinds of friends. So the Gestapo started observing the group\nfor months. And the group at one point realizes that they've\nbeen basically found out, and then it's already too late.\nThen they capture quite a few of them, and quite a few get trial,\nmilitary trial, and receive the death penalty, and are also being executed.\nAnd Harro and Libertas are among them. And also, that last chapter\nof their lives is very well-documented, and it actually ends with\nthat letter, you know, that I found in the beginning. That's the last thing that\nHarro does, is write that letter. - To his father. - That's very interesting what happens\nwith Libertas because she gets in custody. The Gestapo asks one\nof their secretaries, Gertrude Breiter, to go in and pose\nas a friend to Libertas. And Libertas actually falls for\nit, and starts telling that secretary who pretends to be her friend\nand kind of helps her with certain things, tells her secrets, and that\nkind of breaks the neck of the group. It's a very tragic\nending. So while my books always contain as much humor as\npossible, that is not a funny story, but it's\na very dramatic story. Even though they had a lot of\nhumor, obviously. I mean, they had parties to recruit people. - What lessons can we learn from that\nabout how to resist totalitarian regimes? Is there some deeper wisdom? - I just think it's admirable to be brave\nand not do things that you cannot really justify in front of your own conscience. I don't know if I would have been so brave.\nI don't even know how my conscience would have been, but I'm probably more the fleeing type.\nLike, a lot of writers would just leave Germany. Like Thomas Mann just left\nGermany and lived in Pacific Palisades. - And then, and then maybe write,\ncriticize, but leave first. - And he criticized it from the outside,\nand he was quite influential. He worked for the BBC. They did\nshows against the Nazis. So you can Maybe you could do more when\nyou leave. It's just you have... Like today, let's say\nwe see something. We live in a system that suddenly changes, and\nwe're not happy with it anymore. Do we just go along and,\nyou know, continue to stare at our smartphone, or do we do\nsomething against it? What do we do? I mean, every situation has\nvery different, you know, conditions, you know. I think\nit's probably even harder now to be in the resistance\nthan it was back then. - But I think it does, at the end of the\nday, boil down to facing yourself, looking yourself in the mirror— that you're facing your conscience\nand doing the courageous thing. And I think that in itself, that it's the tree falling in the forest, even if\nthere's nobody there to hear it. Just the fact that that exists, somehow\nthrough the karma channels of the world— can materialize into progress,\ninto a revolution against oppression. Something about that\nhuman spirit still shining through can start a revolution. - I mean, it is that spirit\nthat actually made us human. It is that neuroplasticity\nin our brain that we we do not just repeat the conditioned sets that we ought to\nrepeat. But that we actually dim down the command center in the\nbrain and let other parts of the brain react, which is the psychedelic\nexperience, basically. That, I think, contributes to the evolution\nof our species. And our species is certainly threatened\nby extinction. So I think if we somehow care for the human race, then resistance becomes a\nvery immediate and important topic, you know. Because you can\nresist, obviously. Your brain is yours. You can resist\nin many ways, you know, by thinking, just by thinking. That's why\nI became a writer when I was a teenager. I was very political. I wanted to change\nthe system. I thought, \"This is not good what's happening.\" This was in\nthe Cold War. Very conservative— I don't know if conservative is even\nthe right word, but Ronald Reagan was president. So I thought my writing... could change the brain waves of the\nreaders basically, and therefore have a neuroplastic effect on the reader. And just because that is what\nliterature is. Literature, and I started off as a novelist,\nand that's really literature. It's about what do you see right now? How do\nyou describe it? So you do it in ways that when you read it, when you read a good\nbook, you feel good because suddenly you see different things, your brain changes.\nYou become more free, I think, if you read good literature.\nThat was always my form of resistance. Communist\nresistance cells would probably say this is nothing, you know,\nbut I think it is resistance. And that's a little bit... I- I think it resembles\na little bit what this group did. Just living differently, not living, you know... That's why\nI said in the beginning, Nazis were bad dancers, because they- ... I think they were good dancers at the\nparties, you know, and they were like, I think it's big. Dancing\ncan be a form of resistance. - Yeah, but I also like the scale when you resist and through that\nresistance you have impact at scale, and I do think writing is\nthat. So if you can encapsulate your, sort of the spirit of that\nresistance into writing, that's- that's beautiful. And some of the greatest\nliterature does exactly that. - Right. That is the aim of my next book. - So is it still called Stoned Sapiens? - Yeah, it's called Stoned Sapiens. - Great title, great title.\nSo what- what is this lens that you're looking at- at\nall of human history through? - I discussed this with already\nmentioned Antony Beevor who is like the master in historical non-fiction\nbooks and said, \"Is it also possible to write a world history?\" Like, about everything,\nbasically. And he said, \"Yes, it is possible.\" It's not easy, because\nyou have to understand like a lot, you know? And obviously\nit will always be a selection. It's clear, you know. That's why I also think that the historical\nscience is basically a fictional science. I mean, I have a foreword, the\nBlitz foreword basically tells that story. Don't... Take it with a grain of\nsalt. Not only Blitz, but every historical book, because we weren't there, you know?\nThat's what Johnny Depp said when the- when the- when the guy said, \"So you\nhad like a mega pint of- of red wine.\" He just said, \"Were you there?\" You know, and the guy wasn't there.\nSo... history, historical sciences is a fiction. But, you know, it- it's a certain\ntype of fiction, and it- it's based on facts. So I'm not inventing\nanything in Stoned Sapiens, and I'm highly\ninterested in the very early human history, and there are not a lot of sources. So the-\nthe beginning of the book is more speculative than, for example,\nthe Vietnam War chapter. In the Vietnam War chapter, I'm\nin Hanoi speaking to Viet Cong generals, asking them did they supply heroin to the- to the GIs which\nwould dimin- which diminished their fighting capability. That's... You can\nresearch that, and that's- that's- that's also a chapter. By the way, the\nVietnam War is not called the Vietnam War in Vietnam. It's called the American\nWar. And also, I was like sitting with these Viet Cong generals in Hanoi\njust like a few weeks ago for researching bring heroin?\" Because there's never\nbeen evidence that it happened this way. There's never been evidence\nthat it happened this way, and they just looked at me and\nthey said, \"There's no Viet Cong.\" Like, \"What are you talking\nabout?\" \"You are the Viet Cong.\" They said, \"No, this is an\nAmerican propaganda term. We were the North Vietnamese Army. We\nnever call ourselves the Viet Cong.\" So the book is full of surprises,\nobviously. But the very early beginning of Stoned Sapiens goes back to\nabout 1.5 million years ago, when Homo Erectus, who also has\nbecome kind of famous by now, Homo Erectus. It's like the\nfirst human that really gets human that really gets\nshit done, you know. - Yeah, they get moving. - Yeah, they move. - And why were they moving? - Why were they moving? I mean, then you can\nexamine exactly where they originated, which was, I mean, it's also disputed\nby now that it's the Great Rift Valley. That only the most fossils have been\nfound there, but that doesn't mean that they originated there. Maybe they\noriginated in the Central African rainforest where fossils disintegrate,\nand only there in the Rift Valley we still find it. But we know for\nsure that in the Great Rift Valley we still find it. So, but we know for\nsure that in the Great Rift Valley there was a plant called khat, which is\na plant speed. So they were using that. So they were using that. It's still\nbeing used now in these countries, in Ethiopia, Yemen, around the Horn of\nAfrica, khat is very normal to use. Yemen, around the Horn of Africa,\nkhat is very normal to use. You chew the leaves, and it gives\nyou like, it's like an amphetamine. It's a plant amphetamine\nbasically. So Homo Erectus, there's no proof that they actually used\nit, but they were living in that area and the plant was there, so\nyou can write about that. So it's interesting because they\nwere able to do certain things, like they shed the fur. They were the first ones to suddenly\nbe naked. And that has the effect that sweat glands are produced.\nHomo Erectus could sweat it out basically when they were very hot.\nBasically when they were very hot. What animals couldn't do\nbecause they had the fur. So an antelope can run faster than a\nHomo Erectus, but after 10 minutes, the antelope has to stop, like what\ndogs do, like their tongue goes out. what dogs do, like their tongue goes out. And humans didn't have to do that because\nthey were sweating, so they could They developed the jogging mode basically. So they were jogging. They were\nnot sprinting to get the animal. They were jogging it, and when the\nanimal couldn't do it, had to rest, then the humans would come and hunt it\ndown. So Homo Erectus was evolutionary very good. And then later one of the\nspecies coming out of Homo Erectus is Homo Sapiens. At one point,\nthere were only about 1,500 people left. There were not a\nlot of Homo sapiens. There was a point in time when there were quite\na few of them, and the problem became inbreeding, and\nthere was a real danger of extinction. They were vulnerable, you know?\nThey were not on top of the food chain yet, so they had to develop consciousness. Consciousness is what\nbasically saved us from extinction. Without human consciousness, we wouldn't\nbe here, you know? That is what made us, in the end, then superior to\nthe other animals. So, how did this happen? You can kind of trace how\nthey moved. You can trace that they went through the\nCentral African rainforest, and there's one plant there\nwhich elephants like, and that's Iboga. And Iboga now\nis the hot thing of the psychedelic renaissance. Iboga, Iboga,\nIboga. But it's also the oldest drug in the book, basically. They saw\nthat elephants were eating Iboga, the root and the leaves, and suddenly\nwere like, walking backwards and were behaving in an unusual way, and\nthen people were also using this. And this was going on over 100,000 years\nin the rainforest. So, you can, you can write a story about that, you know. Was\nit maybe Iboga? Of course, you can't prove it. You know, maybe the frontal\ncortex grew by itself, you know? - That's a really compelling story.\nThat's one of the great mysteries of... How did the light turn on? - Right. - The magic of human cognition\nand consciousness, and the... - Like Sapiens by Harari, which is a\ngreat book, he also misses that. Like, when it comes to those\nmoments, he writes like, \"We don't understand how the first\ncognitive revolution and the second cognitive revolution actually\nhappened.\" So, I find it interesting to kind of look, could it\nhave been drugs? Like, I include, like everything\nhe leaves out, I I- I- I look at thoroughly in Stoned Sapiens. - I mean, he does a good explanation of\ninteresting consequences, you know? Our ability to imagine ideas and share them,\nand, you know, collaborate on them, and the imagination, all that\nkind of stuff. But the why, the transitions of why did it happen,\nhe doesn't provide, right? I mean, there's some theories,\nbut if Iboga is one of them, that's a compelling one.\nThat's a really compelling one. - Yeah. I mean, I'm still researching this\nbook and writing it. I also want to go there, because they still take\nIboga in Gabon, for example. I also interviewed one of the leading Iboga experts\nat Columbia University, and for Stoned Sapiens, and he described how\nIboga works in the brain, because that's... And he's\nnever taken Iboga himself. - Oh, interesting. - He just relies on the data.\nHe doesn't want to be personally influenced. But he said he\nwill take it at a certain point in time. But right now, he's still just working on data, just with patients,\nyou know? And what he found, and and also examining the brain through\nbrain scanners, what actually happens. Like classic psychedelics,\nlike LSD or psilocybin, they dock at certain points. They interact\nwith certain receptors. It's quite well-understood how they work.\nAnd he said iboga is completely different. It's like... and he also\nshowed this with his hands, because he's just so mesmerized by his\nown findings. Like it's kind of everywhere at the same\ntime in the brain. He says it's like a spa for\nthe neurons, basically. The it's... his findings show, and\nthese are academic findings at Columbia, that iboga...\nit's like, as if, he says, he said to me, as if iboga would\nknow our brain for a long time. Like, it knows exactly.\nLike if you're addicted to something, or if you're\ndepressed. The depression literally is a depression in the\nneuronal network. Depression is a thought loop, for example, or, you\nknow, a system of thought loops that you're, that, \"I'm not worthy, I'm\nnot whatever, I can't do it.\" You always go back. This is... It\nreally kind of depresses your brain in a way. And iboga sees this immediately, and kind\nof takes the depression out and and makes your brain go basically well\nagain. So this is what he, this is what his findings are. So, he says he's\ntotally convinced this is like a... He doesn't call it a plant. He\ncalls it like a neurotechnology of the 22nd century. So\niboga really seems to be in a different kind of\ncategory. That's why I really feel that \"Stoned Sapiens\" must\nbe written, because there's so much that historians just shied away from.\nIt all started when I was on the island of Crete, the biggest\nisland of Greece. Crete, that's another, like, Harari\nmoment. On Crete was the first what is called high culture of Europe, the\nMinoan culture. You might have heard of the Minoan culture. And no\none can explain so far, why there on Crete, suddenly\nin Europe, they started making amazing structures and\namazing art, and how did it happen there that this,\nlike, totally backwards place, Crete, became... I mean,\nbackwards as any other place, you know? Why did it happen there\nthat such intricate objects were being made and that the\nculture was developing so intensely? And I was kind of thinking\nabout that. That's how the book started. I was with my kids on vacation in Crete. And if you go to, like,\nKnossos or Phaistos, the big archeological sites, or to the museum in Heraklion, you don't find\nan answer. Why did it happen there? And then I found like an old\nbook in an old bookshop, and it described an excavation site at the\nsea, and that it was like maybe a maritime place, or like a harbor basically.\nAnd then while I was swimming there, I found on the sea floor, the remnants of\na wall that was a harbor wall that was out, that was breaking the waves,\nand then I climbed over the fence because the archeological\nsite is still fenced off, like it's not explained\nofficially what it is, and the walls in there are\nthe biggest walls of the whole Bronze Era. It was\nactually quite a big harbor. The next step\nis, what did they trade? And they traded olive oil because Crete\nwas the first place to produce olive oil. And I also found, and this is\nhistorically documented, opium was made in Crete and the poppy flower was\ngrowing there. And this was the harbor. They became incredibly\nwealthy through olive oil and opium trade through that\nharbor. So you could say that the whole of European\nhigh culture, which we goes from Minoan, goes to Athens. It all started basically with, you know, they\nwere drug dealers in a way. Or they... I mean, it was the most potent medicine,\n'cause it was the only medicine that numbs the pain for sure. Opium works,\nand the Minoans developed that. So, I mean, it's kind of, it's a bit similar\nto the Blitz experience. You know the more I researched, the more I found - that there's this whole\ncomponent to human history... ...that could be a really critical\ncomponent. I'm really interested about the origin... There's certain leaps,\nlike the origins of human civilization, and then the origins of\nHomo sapiens. Those are really big leaps. - I mean, there's some evidence, like, they\ncame through the area where Iboga was, but there's no academic proof. So, I guess an academically trained historian\ncouldn't really write about that. But I can write about it. I\ncan write about possibilities. - Yeah, sometimes... The\nfarther into history you go, the more it's about\nwriting the possibilities. - I mean, it's also interesting,\nwhy did the Neanderthals die out? And what we can compare is the\ncave art. And the cave art of the Neanderthals is\nmuch simpler than ours. If you really get into the cave art,\nI don't know if you've done that. - Have not, no. - It's quite fascinating. Picasso\nlooked at some of the cave paintings in Southern France, and\nhe said, \"We didn't learn anything new.\" And if you study them,\nthey're really good. But only the humans are good. The Neanderthals, they\nwere worse artists than us. And you can also see, there's a very famous\none that comes from Algeria with a shaman, and around\nhis body, mushrooms grow out of his body, so he was a mushroom\nshaman. So mushrooms seem to have been, part, at least in that area. And\nthat's the 'Stoned Ape' theory, that Terence McKenna did. And I think\na lot of evidence kind of points to it that we were able to\ndevelop our consciousness in a better way than the\nNeanderthals who did not have a drug culture. They were\nbasically too sober for the future. We assimilated them.\nThey had no chance against our impetus of boldly going where no one\nhas gone before. They were much more happy with what they had. They were not\nprogressing all the time. Like, we have the transcendental kind of moment, which is, you know, the psychedelic\nexperience. I guess you could think of it without\nit, but to imagine Sapiens makes more sense to imagine\nSapiens as Stoned Sapiens, as a species that was able to\nincorporate psychoactive components into its development. It\nmakes a lot of sense. - What about one of the great, if\nyou can think of it that way, technologies that humans have developed\nis religion. Religion evolved different kinds. Do you\nthink there's a connection between psychedelics and religion, the\ndevelopment of religion throughout different parts of the world? - Well, I think Moses is quite\ninteresting. Moses was a traumatized man that had fled Egypt\nwhere he had killed a man who had been beating up a Hebrew, so Moses kind\nof took revenge and killed him. So he was running from the law and he was together with, in the\nBible it says, I think 66 people, they were in the desert,\nin the Sinai, and they had been fasting for days and no\nalcohol, so it was kind of a psychedelic retreat, basically. I\nmean, this is being examined by Israeli scholars and I think it's very\ninteresting work. They examine in detail what does the Bible say, and the Bible\nmentions in that passage where Moses sees the burning bush and then\ngets the Ten Commandments. In that Bible passage, there's a lot of several times the acacia is\nmentioned. And the Egyptian acacia grows right in the Sinai area and contains\nDMT. So there's this Israeli research that Moses was actually having\na trip, basically, that he was seeing, he was hallucinating\nthe burning bush, was... you know, if you take\nLSD and you look at a bush in the heat, you know, it\nwill move, you know? It might resemble, like, a burning experience.\nAnd you know, experience. And he went up the mountain, which takes\nthree hours, while the others were staying down. And with the DMT type of experience, it's not that everyone in\nthe group has the same experience, you know, to Ayahuasca. Sometimes,\nlike, one guy has an incredible experience, while another person\nmight not feel that much at all. And Moses felt a lot. And you do\nfeel a lot when you, you know, when you are, when you have something\nto work through, and he had certainly something to work through,\nthe trauma of killing a man. So it's also no surprise that he receives\none of the commandments, \"You should not kill.\" You know? So for him, it's\nlike extremely, extremely important and, what he receives on the mountain, that God is like, there's someone speaking\nto me, and he understands that God is not, that there's not many\ngods, just one God. Like, he has a revelation, you know? And\nI think it, when I, when I read, you know, these examinations by\nthese scholars, I think it makes a lot of sense to imagine that the\nJewish religion comes from Moses' trip. And also, if you\nlook at the Jewish religion, they are quite open to drugs. I don't know if\nthat, you know, that could be an unconscious reaction to that, to that kind\nof trippy beginning. Like, they to get intoxicated to get closer to\nGod. They're not as straight-laced to get closer to God. They're\nnot as straight-laced as the Christians. They just allow\nalcohol. It's like the blood of Christ. Blood of Christ. So, Stoned\nSapiens is a book about religion. Islam and intoxication is also\na very interesting topic, 'cause you have the Sufis who intoxicate\nthemselves to get into ecstasy, themselves to get into\necstasy, to be closer to God. And then you have the conservative\nIslamic scholar, Ibn Taimiyya, who defended Damascus against the\nMongols by combining anti-drug rhetoric, like, \"They're bringing drugs to\nus and they are not good Muslims.\" So, drugs in religion. Sometimes drugs\nhelp religion, like, are used in religious religion to, like, are used in religious\ncontexts. But then you can also contexts. But then you can also\nsee that religions work as prohibitionist movements against\ndrugs, like the Christian church. Also the Purity Law, for example,\nit's very famous in Germany. It's called the Reinheitsgebot.\nBeer can only contain three things: water, hops, and barley\nor something like that. barley or something like\nthat. That's the Purity Law. And that was done by the\nchurch in the 16th century. And in Germany, for a long time,\nthis was seen as a quality control. seen as like, this is like a quality\ncontrol, like beer has to be pure, it only has these ingredients.\nBut it's actually a move by the church to weed out all the\nother ingredients that had been put in beer before, like\nnightshade plants. So beer... Also, witches were brewing crazy\nbeer you drink and you have visions and you have like visions and you\ndance around the fire. And the church didn't like this. So the church\nsaid, \"This is the beer now.\" And especially, hops was the\nnew ingredient for the beer. And so the Purity Law is the\nfirst prohibitionist law in the Middle Ages in Europe.\nAnother fascinating... - Yeah. I think as society develops\nmore and more, it seems to resist, certainly psychedelics, it seems to resist\ndrugs. I don't know what that's about. - One of the very fascinating turning\npoints that I've been able to pinpoint, or at least I think this is\nwhat happened, is when do the first kings come up? They weren't\nkings for a very long time. The first king that I can identify\nwas in the so-called Sumerian high culture, was in Uruk, was\nGilgamesh. And they wrote the Uruk, was Gilgamesh. And they wrote the\nGilgamesh epic about the great king. Gilgamesh epic about, you know, the\ngreat king. But that was four or 5,000 years ago, something like that.\nBut what happened in the thousands But what happened in the thousands\nof years before, there's no source source that there were\nrulers. It seems like humans were quite good in organizing\nthemselves without kings before these first kings came. I\nmean, thousands of years from the end of the Ice Age until the\nSumerian high culture, there were no kings. So people were quite able to organize\ntheir communities. There was, for example, Çatal Hüyük in Eastern Turkey- ...that was working for like 2,000\nyears without any hierarchies. I think that is quite interesting,\nand then why do suddenly the hierarchies start and\nwhat makes the hierarchy stronger? And again, I'm\nstill researching this, but in Sumeria, we can see that it's the\nbeer that destroys the hierarchy-free society, because they are\nable... I mean, beer is quite old. The first beer was\nmade in Gobekli Tepe, the famous first kind of structure of mankind.\nI also write about that, because it's very interesting. Small detour, what is Gobekli Tepe? No\none knows. How did they make it? No one knows, but they made it, but\nwhy did they make it? I think they made it because they were\ncreating a meeting place, and why was that so important? There were not\nso many humans at the time, there were like one to 4 million, those are\nthe estimates, on the whole planet. And they were usually living in small\ncommunities of like a hundred people up to 500, not more. So the problem\nthen is inbreeding. Inbreeding means it's a degeneration,\nso it's a problem. We are genetically not so\ndiverse, actually, as humans, so Gobekli Tepe people were\nmeeting from different areas, having sex with people they usually\nwouldn't see creating healthy children. And Gobekli Tepe was working\nfor 1,600 years, and I think it was like an evolutionary\nkind of machine. Like, without that idea, we're going\nto create a party place. You know, it was a party, basically. They were\neating very well. They found a lot of bones, but no one lived there. They just came\ntogether there for parties. And then after 800 years, they start\nmaking beer there, and then the situation slightly changes.\nThey found this beer, these places where they made\nbeer. You can still find the chemicals and it's sure\nthat they made beer there. And then once they make\nbeer, they create different stone circles, and then somehow, it changes.\nAnd we can see clearly how it changes in the Sumerian\nhigh culture when beer... Beer then becomes a business.\nBeer is being done by the priests, by the ruling class,\nor ruling class emerges. Like, monasteries often brew beer,\nand that was also the case in the Sumerian high culture. They make beer. They labeled the\nbeer, like the temple that would make the beer, the beer would be\nattributed to that temple. It would be sold, so that temple kind of rises\nin status, makes money. So that's how hierarchies started up.\nSo the hierarchy, which is the big problem right now, that we have these hierarchies,\nthat we have these kings everywhere that kind of steal our money or at least\nmake it very difficult for us as humans to organize on an egalitarian planetary scale, which\nis our only chance for survival. If we, at one\npoint, overcome the hierarchies, overcome the\nnation-states, and create a planetary, probably AI-assisted,\nopen source AI-assisted planetary society and everyone\nhas the same political rights, there's no more borders, there's\na planetary minimum income, so no one is starving. Everyone has at\nleast what everyone needs, which is totally possible. It's just a\nproblem of organizing and of breaking the resistance of those who\ndon't like that, and there's a lot of resistance, obviously. I mean, I'm talking\nabout what's happening on the planet in 50 years, not what's gonna happen\ntomorrow, but that is where we slowly are moving towards. And you\ncan see that this actually comes from, you know, a\ntime when we were able to organize ourselves without kings.\nWe don't need kings. Kings always say, \"If you don't have me, then\nsomeone else, some other guy will come.\" But, you know, that's why I mean, that's why I'm not... You\nknow, if a nation-state makes war against another nation-state, I'm\nnot taking a position and saying, \"This country is, like, better.\"\nBasically, both nation-states are doing war, and who has to suffer is us, you\nknow? It's Stoned Sapiens, it's the human species. - Speaking of which, I have to ask you...\nSo, I've done psilocybin a bunch, and I've done ayahuasca, but\nI've never done LSD, acid, and you have quite a bit. So,\nmaybe the big general question is what's LSD like? In the space of\npsychedelics, which funny enough, we haven't really spoken a\nlot about psychedelics... - Right - ...except in the context of\nStoned Sapiens. What's LSD like? - Well, this is probably the third book\nthat we want to talk about, is-is- - Tripped - ...Tripped, because Tripped is an\nexamination of the history of LSD. And that sounds maybe less interesting\nthan it actually is. It's- It's... I mean, I find it fascinating.\nI had tried LSD. It was given to me by my girlfriend at the time, Anya, in\nLower Manhattan on a Saturday night, 1993. So, I was, like, 23. And she said, \"Let's take LSD.\" And\nI'd never really taken any drug. Like, I'd maybe smoked a\nbit of weed, but I didn't know what a strong drug\nis. And she gave me this paper, and I took it, and\nwe walked around in the East Village, pre-gentrified\nEast Village. It's pretty cool, actually. And\nit didn't work. For like one hour, I felt nothing, and then I\nwent into the toilet. I had a falafel or something. I went into\nthe toilet, and there was a mirror. Like, I was peeing, and\nthen there was this mirror. But the walls had, like, lines. They\nwere painted in lines. Suddenly, these lines started to, like, vibrate,\nand that's... Then the trip started, and it was such an empowerful that I thought I would go insane. Like,\nit was the worst trip I've ever had. - You got scared? - ...it was so strong. I was totally\nscared. I didn't know what it was. I I suddenly... I walked. I said to\nmy girlfriend, \"It's working.\" And she said, \"Yes, it's\nworking. I feel it also.\" And I went into No-Tell Motel,\nwhich was my favorite bar, just to be in a familiar environment. It's\nnot a good idea on your first very strong LSD trip to be out- ...in Lower Manhattan on a Saturday\nnight, but I also didn't know this. You know? So, I was in the bar, and\nI saw my friend, Dora Espinoza, from Peru. She was quite a small woman. She was only, like, I don't know the\nAmerican system, maybe 1 meter 50, so she was quite short. Short is the right\nword. But on LSD, she was like this. - Like, tiny. - So I saw her down there, like... And\nI said, \"Dora, do I look normal? Because you look very small.\" And Dora's like, \"No, you look\nfine.\" I'm like, \"Okay, I gotta get outta here.\" And then we walked\nup to 2nd Avenue, and we saw, like, a bunch of Puerto Rican kids killing one of their... It was a gang.\nKind of, it was more of a druggy kind of... I mean, Manhattan back then\nwas kind of dangerous in the East Village. And they killed one\nof them on the hood of the car. In front of our eyes, we\nsaw it, and I said, \"Do you see this? Thank you, my God.\" And\nthen they resurrected him, like, they gave him mouth-to-mouth,\nand the guy was fine again. And we walked past, and we were not\nsure anymore what we were seeing. And this was a very strong\nhallucination. And then we saw a full-blown racial riot on 2nd\nAvenue. People were smashing in taxi windows, pulling the drivers\nout. It was like a- A GTA. - Grand Theft Auto? Yeah. - Right, it was like that. And... - So most of this is\nbasically hallucinating. - I think so, yeah. And I have taken- - But it felt real. - It felt totally real. And so\nI was happy when this trip was over, because I thought I\nhad gone insane, basically. I thought there was a switch in my\nbrain that had been, like, switched. Something chemical. I have now a chemical\nimbalance in my brain, I'm gonna be crazy for the rest of my life. I thought that.\nBut after, like, 10 hours, it suddenly got, you know, the effects\nwore off, and I became normal again. And I thought that was quite fascinating.\nSo in hindsight, I thought it was a great experience, even though it was quite scary.\nBut it also had moments of incredible perceptions, like I could see\nthat the atoms are not, you know, rigid. Obviously everything's\nmoving in our universe. Everything. There's nothing fixed, you\nknow? So I could see that. I could see that everything\nwas basically alive, and that my previous perceptions\nof how the world is is just my conditioned perception,\nand that the world was very different, and, you know, just how you\nlook at it, it looks different, and... - So it was freeing in a way? - Yeah, totally freeing. Also, it was much\nstronger than all the LSD I've taken since. And I've taken high\ndosages, so I'm not even sure if that was LSD. There are\nalso other compounds - Okay - that are quite rare, like DOM or\nwhatever. Maybe it was something else. But then I also spoke to LSD experts by now, also for the\nbook Tripped. And it can happen that your first trip is much\nstronger than all the other trips, because your brain kind of\nreacts very strongly to it. Because what happens in the brain is\nbasically that the default mode network receives less energy, and other parts\nof the brain, they communicate better. So if this happens for the first time,\nyour brain maybe is totally surprised by this firework that's going on,\nand then creates hallucinations, so it can somehow make sense of it. There's\na lot of things firing, and then so you see things that maybe are not there. But\nthat's not usual on an LSD trip. You don't have such hallucinations. Like, you don't have... I've never had such hallucinations\nafterwards again, you know? - What's the usual experience on LSD? - It really depends on the dosage. If\nyou microdose, it's just like drinking an espresso that lasts maybe for\ntwo, three hours in a very pleasant way, so you're just slightly buzzed. - Is it visual artifacts, like- - No - ... color? - Then you would take, like, more.\nMaybe if you take 50 micrograms, the colors become more intense. But if you\ntake a microdose of 10 micrograms, nothing happens. The trip starts with about\n100 micrograms. And then you could see maybe it would be... Like, I took, uh, I took a swimming trip in\nThailand in January, and I took about 200 micrograms,\nwhich is quite a lot. I just, because it was so beautiful on this\nisland, and it was kind of, \"Will it be more beautiful if I'm on LSD now?\" And\nof course, every LSD trip also tells you about your life, like, some\nthings you didn't understand. Suddenly you see, like, \"Oh, it's like\nthis.\" It's very good for, you know, reflecting on your life. But\nit's also a lot of fun. So I swam for, like, three hours through the ocean,\nwhich is something you usually don't do, you know? I like swimming,\nbut after, like, 10 minutes or 20 minutes, I go out. But I was\nswimming and swimming and... So- - Yeah, for me on the psilocybin\nand ayahuasca, there's a intensification of beauty\nof the world around you. Whether that's nature, or whether that's\npeople, or whether that's your own memories of your past, or maybe your imagination\nmanifesting itself in different kinds of visuals. You know, on\nayahuasca, I saw dragons of different kinds, and they were\njust really beautiful. Um, and maybe I've never taken, like,\na heroic dose of psilocybin, but it was always, everything was just\nalways so beautiful, and I was just grateful to be alive and grateful to be in this world and\nget to appreciate it in this most intense way. There's something about, like you\nsaid, you could see the individual atoms. Like, there are\ncertain ways to deconstruct, or maybe to visualize or reinterpret,\nrevisualize the world, that makes you like, appreciate, \"Holy shit,\nthis is really, this is really awesome. This is\nreally special.\" And that can only be done through the process of, showing you a different\nversion of it a little bit. - I mean, when the Swiss\npharmaceutical company Sandoz developed LSD in 1943, they were having to solve the big question,\n\"What is it good for?\" Albert Hofmann, the chemist, he found\nit basically involuntarily. And he reported to the CEO, \"I had very\nstrong reactions, basically, in the brain.\" So they set up\nan intoxication room. I found the documents about this\nintoxication room in the Novartis archive when I researched Tripped\nbecause Novartis bought Sandoz in the '90s. So all the\nLSD stuff is in the Novartis archive. And this intoxication room, I always think is kind of interesting\nto imagine. This was 1943; there's a World War going on everywhere in Europe,\nexcept in Switzerland, which is a neutral country. But\nBasel, where the LSD was found, is like a stone's throw from the\nGerman border, so you actually hear the war going on. And so they\ncreated a nice room within the company, and then all the employees\nvoluntarily could go and take LSD. So they were the first people\nto take LSD, and they had no idea that there was, at one\npoint, MKUltra. You know, they were just trying out\nsomething that one of their guys had developed. And I read through\nall these reports, and they all had a great experience, like\nsitting in a nice chair. And they looked outside the window,\nand they were reporting stuff like, \"I just had to laugh the\nwhole time. I felt so good. I realized about my life.\" Or it kind of created in them\nthe feeling like a heightened sense of sensitivity and a\nfeeling that this is the life, this is how life\nshould feel, kind of. So the CEO, Arthur Stoll, he was really\ntrying to figure out what he could market it for, because he thought\nmaybe this is a game changer in mental health. Because this was\nbefore antidepressants, before antipsychotics, and it was\nin the middle of World War II, which had created already\nmillions of traumatized people. \"How do you treat these\npeople?\" So they thought LSD could be really a big, big, big\nthing. And I mean, I came... I just told you when I first took\nLSD, and I somehow was interested in LSD, but I never thought I would write a\nbook about it. I just used it once in a while when I wanted to understand something\nabout my life or just enjoy a day in the ocean. But I read a study that microdoses\nof LSD, at one point, help against Alzheimer's, and my mother has\nAlzheimer's. So I discussed this with my father who takes care of my mother,\nand this was an academic study. I discussed this also with a\nleading Alzheimer's expert that I interviewed for Tripped, and he's like,\n\"Wow, this is amazing.\" Because LSD interacts with the very\nsame receptors, the 5-HT2A receptors in the brain, that LSD interacts with those receptors and Alzheimer\ndestroys those receptors. So LSD basically does the opposite\nthat Alzheimer does. And I discussed this with my father\nand he said, \"So why can't I buy LSD in the pharmacy if it's\nso good?\" You know? He was a judge before. He actually put\npeople in prison for drugs. So he said, \"You better bring me the\nstory.\" So I did a kind of a research loop. This is the book Tripped. Then I\ncame back to him in the end with the true story of why LSD has been made\nillegal, and that is quite fascinating because the Swiss CEO, Stoll, he\nhad learned biochemistry. This is very nerdy, but I think it's quite\ninteresting. He had learned biochemistry from the Jewish German god of biochemistry,\nWillstätter. Richard Willstätter was Nobel Prize winner for\nchemistry, and his work was he would extract the potent alkaloids from\nso-called poisonous plants and make, you know, poison. Paracelsus taught us it's the dosage that makes the poison,\nyou know? If you take too much of a potent alkaloid, maybe it's\na poison, but if you extract a potent alkaloid, maybe you could\nturn it into a medicine. So Stoll learned this from Willstätter, and there\nwas another guy that was learning from Willstätter, Richard Kuhn. So it\nwas Kuhn and Stoll. Those were the two students of Willstätter, and they, Stoll left and became the\nCEO of Sandoz and developed the pharmaceutical branch of\nSandoz. And Kuhn became Hitler's leading biochemist and was\nresponsible in finding a truth drug and also developing nerve gas. But\nthe two guys, Kuhn and Stoll, stayed friends also when the Nazis\ntook power. I researched the papers of Stoll in the\narchive, and in the '20s, he would communicate all the ergot\nresearch. LSD is an ergot product. Ergot is a fungus that grows on rye.\nHe would communicate all this with Kuhn, and Kuhn would come to the\nSandoz lab, and they did experiments together. And then in '43,\nKuhn was, you know, a hardcore Nazi scientist, and especially\nlooking for the truth drug at the time. I was looking\nthrough the archive, I wanted to find the connection that Stoll\nalso sent LSD to Kuhn, because when I was researching for Blitzed in\nDachau, I had found that the SS had done in the concentration camp\nof Dachau, experiments with mescaline and another hallucinogenic\nsubstance which was not named. And mescaline has the\nproblem... The truth drug idea is I give you something\nwithout you noticing it, like something that doesn't smell or taste\nlike anything. Then after half an hour, I know that something's working in\nyour brain, and you become insecure because suddenly something's working\nin your brain. I can play with that situation, and therefore extract all the\nsecrets from you because it's a power. I'm suddenly above you because I know\nsomething about you that you don't know. That was the idea. The\nproblem with mescaline was it has a bitter taste, and it's hard to make. And LSD is very easy to make. Not\nvery easy, but it's quite easy. And LSD is odorless and tasteless.\nSo I was trying to... I somehow had the notion that LSD has a\nNazi past, you know, which is something that no one ever thinks about. LSD is\nlike the hippie drug, right? It's a drug of the peace people. But I wanted to see all\nthe papers of Stoll, the CEO. And the archivist, he already knew, like he\nwas the Swiss archivist. This is not a public archive. In a public archive, you\nbasically, like the National Archives of the United States, you see what's\nthere, you have the right to see it, freedom of information. But\na company archive, like Novartis archive, the archivist can just\nsay, \"No,\" you know, \"I can't find this right...\" You know,\nyou're basically at his mercy. So I bribed him with\nLSD because he didn't want to show me the Stoll papers.\nAnd I said to him, just to distract him, \"Have you\never seen LSD?\" And he's like, \"No. Why? How would I see it?\" And I said, \"Well, I have some here.\"\nAnd I had some, I just had gotten it from a friend. - What does LSD look like? Tabs or... - Yeah, a tab. I had a\npaper. And the funny thing about... Yeah, these are\ndifferent designs, you know. - Oh, and you can put it on your tongue?\nIs that how people usually take it? - Right. Yeah. You take it like\nthat. And the one I had was given to me by a Swiss friend and it\nhad... Like here you see certain prints on - Oh, yeah. - And it had the print of the old logo of Sandoz from the '40s. So the\nguys who make this illegal LSD in Basel, in some kind of lab, they\nknow where it comes from. So they made like a joke to make the old logo of Sandoz. I\nshowed this to the archivist, and he said, \"This has the old logo of our company.\" I said, \"Well,\nit was made by your company.\" He said, \"I know this, but it's not... This is\nvery interesting, actually.\" And I said, \"I'm going to\ngift you one of these trips now.\" And he said, \"Wow, you really,\nyou would do this?\" And I said, \"You can archive it.\" And he's like, \"Ha-ha-ha.\"\nAnd then he actually took one, he was... And then the ice broke. - That's great. - And then he said, \"Okay, I'm going to show\nyou now the correspondence of Stoll, our CEO. It's no problem.\" And he just went to the next\nroom and he looked for like 10 minutes, and then he brought me these boxes. And then I actually saw the correspondence\nbetween Stoll and Kuhn, between the Swiss CEO and the German Nazi\nscientist, what they were talking about. And then I found a smoking\ngun, October 1943. Kuhn acknowledges that he receives half a gram of ergotamine,\nwhich is the precursor drug to LSD. And so it's highly likely that the Nazis used LSD together with mescaline in\nDachau. And when the Americans liberated the Dachau camp,\nthey had a special unit called Alsos with them. And Alsos' job\nwas to find German scientists and interview them, get their knowledge\nfor the nuclear program mostly, but also for biochemical weapons. And\none of the first persons they interrogated was Richard Kuhn, and Richard Kuhn\nimmediately collaborated because he didn't want to go to the Nuremberg trial.\nHe wanted to continue his career actually. He was an opportunist, so I guess\nhis Nazi convictions were not so strong after all, because he also liked the\nAmericans. So he told the Americans immediately about LSD. And the next day, a\nvery high general flew from the States to Frankfurt, went to Heidelberg,\nspoke to Kuhn again. Then, he took off his uniform and went\nin civil clothing to Basel, because Switzerland is\nneutral, and received the first LSD from Stoll's son. So, the American general had LSD. This was in\n'45 in the summer. Then the American military started to examine LSD. Could LSD be the truth\ndrug? Because if the Nazis think so, maybe it's true, because\nthe Nazis were cutting-edge scientists as evil as they were. - In Dachau, this was presumably used for the\ndifferent experimentation that was done. - Well, I read one report from a guy who\nwas an inmate, and he received it in coffee, and he had a\nfull-blown psychedelic trip. And he had this SS guy who\nwas asking him questions, and the guy had such a great trip. I would always imagine you'd have a terrible trip\nin a concentration camp, but he was seeing fractals and colors, and he could see that there\nwas something bigger than these Nazis, and there was something bigger than the\nconcentration camp. And he only said it was so horrible when the trip ended and he\nbecame sober again and was just an inmate again in the concentration camp. - I mean, one of the things you get from\nbooks like Man's Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl is that in the\nconcentration camp actually, the slightest good things are so rich of... - Right - ...feeling. You just get... So, I would actually expect to have incredible\ntrips there because you're just grateful for anything\npositive, anything positive. - Yeah, I didn't think about that. - It becomes intensified. - Makes sense. - But from the perspective of the Nazis,\nthey're trying to develop the truth drug. - They miserably failed because LSD...\n...Is not the truth drug. LSD leads you closer to your own truth, because\nwhen suddenly the default mode network receives less energy and other\nparts of the brain think more and the brain becomes neuroplastic, you know, the\nneuroplasticity of the brain is enhanced and is stimulated, you might\nunderstand something about your life. You might not, you know. LSD\ndoesn't necessarily turn you into a more knowledgeable person. You\ncould also focus that on your Orthodox belief system. But many\npeople realize different things, have different ideas. So it doesn't work as\nthis conditioning drug. But also the CIA then kind of took over the LSD experiments that the US military\ntook over from the SS. So now it's in CIA hands. In 1947,\nCentral Intelligence Agency is founded, because America\ndidn't have a Central Intelligence Agency before. They had,\nlike, the military agencies like OSS. Now they have the CIA, and the CIA\nmakes Dulles, the first director, he says, \"The brain warfare is going on now\nbetween the Soviet Union and us. This is Cold War. We have to...\" you\nknow, maybe they are using something against us. We have to be\nreally on our, you know, we have to be prepared, you know, for the brain\nwarfare, 'cause Communism is a propagandistic system. So they\nwere always, like, either really afraid or just pretending to be afraid the\nSoviet Union would, you know, develop the truth drug quicker than them. So the LSD truth drug program which\nwas labeled MKULTRA, the infamous MKULTRA is, is a mind control\nprogram. I mean, it is, and LSD played a big part in it. - It's a deeply illegal one. - It certainly... I mean, it was never\napproved by Congress or anything that. - It's probably deeply unethical,\nmaybe one of the more un-American, unethical things\ndone in, in recent times. - It's certainly unethical. It\ncontinues the Nazi human experiments. - Right. - That's what the CIA did. - It's, it's continuing one of the worst\naspects of what the Nazis were doing. Defeated the Nazis and carried the\nflag forward. It's, it's just dark. - And this is basically the reason why\nLSD at one point became illegal, because it did not get the chance...\nStoll still wanted to put it on the market, but Sidney\nGottlieb, the head of MKULTRA, he really didn't want LSD to\nbe on the market. He wanted, not because he thought it's not good or dangerous for anybody, he\njust wanted to control LSD. He wanted LSD to be his so he could use it for\nMKULTRA, for experiments. He couldn't really stop. There was also legit LSD\nresearch always going on until it was prohibited in 1966.\nThere was legit LSD research done in universities which came\nto all kinds of conclusions. But the decisive thing was a visit by\nGottlieb in the office of Stoll in Basel where he basically says to\nStoll, he comes with a suitcase with 240,000 US dollars to buy the world's supply of LSD, because he has the\ninformation from the American ambassador. Like he has, he said like, \"I think, we think by now Sandoz has\nproduced, like, 400 kilograms of LSD.\" So that was the price for this 400. And Stoll\nsaid, \"No, actually we have produced only 400 grams.\" And \"But I'll sell\neverything to you, of course.\" I mean, because the pressure that\nhe received from the CIA was, 'cause the CIA and the FDA, they're\nquite friendly organizations. So the CIA has a certain influence\non the FDA, at least back then, you know? So the pressure was\nif you want to put your medicines on the market, which is of\ncourse the biggest market in the world, and Sandoz, you know, I'm sure you\nwant to thrive as a pharmaceutical company, then LSD is not going to\nbe one of these products. And Stoll basically betrayed LSD. So he said okay,\nand LSD was only distributed as a research drug. It was never sold by the\ncompany. So researchers could actually write to Sandoz, \"I'm\ndoing this and this test, and I'm a neuroscientist, I need\nLSD.\" Then they would receive it. But mostly what happened to the LSD was it went into the CIA's\nhands, and then it was used in MKULTRA. But then it spilled out,\nobviously, because one of the guinea pigs was Ken Kesey.\nHe received 75 US dollars for taking LSD for the CIA,\nand he was working in Menlo Park in a psychiatric ward. And on LSD,\nhe basically had the idea to write One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest. He\nunderstood that these people maybe are not crazy. It's just a different\nway of seeing. That's like an LSD revelation. These are not bad, crazy\npeople. They just see the world differently. Because that\nneuroplasticity that kind of leads you away from one\nway of thinking. You realize that there are different\nways. So, I would say, LSD the tendency of LSD is more to increase... - Empathy? That kind of thing? - ...empathy, diversity,\nall these kind of things. - So because you mentioned the\neffect of LSD on you as a writer, that it at least\nchanged the way you write. - Well, I mean, the book Tripped is a book where\nI come back with that story to my father, and then my father decides to give\nLSD to my mother. And we did the LSD, the three of us, on Christmas. And we did mushrooms on Mother's Day.\nAnd whenever my mother takes LSD, and Alzheimer's\nis a horrible disease, obviously. For example, on Mother's\nDay, there was the newspaper lying on the balcony. We were\nsitting in the sun, and she was on mushrooms. It's just a microdose,\nyou know? It's not that you have a trip, but you have that stimulation of your brain. That's what you have. Even her\nbrain, attacked by Alzheimer's, reacted stronger than my father. He\nalways says, \"I never feel anything from a microdose.\" And you're not supposed to feel\nanything, but my mother suddenly picked up the newspaper, which she hadn't\nlooked at for a year. So on mushroom microdoses, she picks up\nthe newspaper and starts reading the headline to us, which was\nabout the Ukraine war. She'd never heard about the Ukraine war.\nSo when she, like, she had problems, like, pronouncing the word Ukraine,\nbecause that was a new word for her, because she hadn't been part\nof the news cycle in about a year. And this was because of the\nmushroom microdose. So this book, how did it change my writing? On an\nemotional level, writing... ...Right. Taking LSD and then writing about LSD\nchanged something in my family. It improved the health of my mother that made me very happy, of course, very\nsatisfied, you know? - Yeah, there's a deep personal connection,\nbut I even mean on Ken Kesey's side, like... - I know what you mean. - I mean, what does it do?\nListen, writing, I don't know. Again, me as a fan of writing,\nit feels like writing is suffering, kind of. When\nI see, just these great writers in history talk about writing,\nit seems like it's really hard, it's a kind of torture. You\nknow, Hemingway, and you have the Kerouac stories that just\nkind of flow out of you. But a lot of times, it's\nreally disciplined, day after day. You're really digging and\ndigging. And so, it's interesting what that looks like under the\ndifferent supplements, right? Like, - Well- - Stephen King famously, I mean, there's\na lot of people, they go to the drugs, to the alcohol. You have\nthe Hunter S. Thompson, who goes, when given the option,\njust says yes to all of it. Um, and the mind is a weird thing.\nAnd a lot of writers talk about how they're not really\ndeveloping the ideas. They're plugging into some, they're channeling. - Right - a voice from somewhere else. And- - Yeah - with psychedelics, that's certainly, it\nfeels like you're modifying the channel. or you're expanding the channel. - Yeah - Or you're directing the channel to a\ndifferent direction. That's why I asked. - I think for me, writing has two important parts, and one of\nthem is the actual writing part, and that's the painful\npart that you talk about. It's basically discipline, focus.\nIt becomes harder and harder to focus because of the telephone. - Yeah, distractions. - There's a place in Switzerland, The Nietzsche\nHouse. I go there as much as I can to write. It's in Sils Maria, it's\nquite high up. Nietzsche went there every summer from 1882 to 1888,\nwith the exception of 1887. He didn't go that summer, I don't know why.\nAnd he stayed there for three months and wrote most of his work - Yeah - in that room. And that room is still\nthere, and his desk is still there. And you can rent rooms in that Nietzsche\nHouse, and it's great. And I do this as often as I can. Only there am I able to switch off the phone in the morning.\nI don't even switch it on. I'm like a soldier. I'm in the Nietzsche\nHouse. Also, Nietzsche House is magical, so it\ngives you so much. I would never take drugs in the Nietzsche\nHouse, because it would disturb that clarity that is in that house. When\nNietzsche wrote Zarathustra and... - You can sense his presence a little bit? - Yeah, I speak to him quite a bit. Like... - Yeah? - His door is always open. - Is he an asshole? Is he a nice guy? - No, he's a nice guy. - Nice guy. - His room cannot be rented. It's always\nlike a museum-type room. And I mean, I never thought of him as an asshole. I\nmean, he's a total weirdo, obviously. - had issues, like, struggled getting laid. - Yeah, I think he had a lot of problems. - That's one of them. But he had\na lot of good qualities too. - But he's also part of Stoned\nSapiens, because he did experiment with drugs there and he writes about it. It's\nvery hard to find, but in the Nietzsche House, I found a book on Nietzsche's medicine history, and he takes quite a bit of\nhashish, he smokes. Is it to help? - Does it help with the stomach\nissues or whatever, or is it... - No, he's interested in what\nhappens in the brain, and this... - Oh, interesting. - ... this comes back to\nyour question how did... The drugs change my writing? Well,\nfirst of all, it's this one. It's this discipline. I can do it up in the\nNietzsche House. I can also do it sometimes in Berlin. It's just sitting there, trying\nto focus and writing. But what you need, of course, is the inspirational part.\nAnd LSD helped me just the first trip to realize that it's not all\nblack and white. The world's quite colorful, and there's\nlike the abyss and it's, there's also the horror. And I\nwas a happy-go-lucky kid, you know. I never thought that the\nworld is so deep as I understand it now. So the LSD makes the world deeper. So I think for me to understand the\nworld better, to understand myself better, it improved my writing,\nbut I would not write on LSD. Because on LSD, you want to walk in\nthe forest or you want to go up the mountain, or that's what\nI like. I would never sit in front of the ugly computer with\na stupid screen and write, you know. Maybe I would lie in the\nmountains with a notebook and kind of write poetic lines. That could\nbe done on LSD, because you have... When I was researching Stoned\nSapiens, I did one LSD trip in... from the Nietzsche House, I went quite\nhigh up in the mountains on LSD, and I came and it was not\njust, it's just, I... I just thought about the book and kind of\nlooked at the different chapters, just did work together, like, kind of like\nmacro without taking too many notes, just kind of letting it,\nyou know, play out in front of, in in my mind. And then when I\nwalked down, I passed a cave. ... and I realized a lot about people's relationship to\ncaves and the cave paintings, how, you know, actually the cave walls, you see all the arteries\nof the rocks. And I mean, on LSD, you see all of that\nand you see how alive that is and how beautiful it actually was\nby humans to then use that canvas. and work your cave paintings\nin there. I mean, I never had the appreciation of that before. - Yeah, you're right. You are able to detect the on psychedelics, the aliveness of\nthe details, if I can put it this way. - For me, it's a very creative drug.\nBut for other people it might not be, you know? So I cannot\nadvertise it, because if you have a psychological\nproblem, maybe it's overwhelming. - Yeah, that's actually a good thing\nto say at this moment, from my perspective, and maybe you can comment\non it. In general, when people ask me, I've done psilocybin a few times and I\ndid ayahuasca, and I've talked about it. When people ask me if\nI recommend those things, I, as a general statement,\nI say no. You know, to the general population. And\nthen as a second step, if I'm talking to specific people on a\ncase-by-case basis, I can just discuss my experience and let that be kind of\nan inspiration. Because I'm very hesitant to recommend a thing that could\nbe so powerful. Because I don't know. Like I had a tremendously\npositive experience, and I was sure I would be meeting some\ndemons. I thought I would have some demons in the basement or something,\nbut I didn't meet them, not yet. And my... But people\nmight have some demons that they meet and then it\nmight destroy them or it might change them in a way they don't like. And actually, it's a good\nquestion for me whether it's good to do psychedelics when you're in\na good place in life or in a bad place in life. Because I know that, even\nscientifically there have been studies where psilocybin\nhelps with extreme sort of depression and PTSD and all\nthese kinds of things. But I'd be very nervous\nabout that too, because the mind is such a powerful thing and\nit's such a complicated thing that with these really powerful tools\nit's unclear where it's going to take you. But I have\nheard a lot of stories of people who have taken incredible\njourneys, sometimes difficult journeys, with psychedelics and have come out\nmuch happier and much freer and have healed some of the things they have\nbeen going through. But when people ask me to recommend or not, I'm just too afraid to say yes. I think\nthe right thing is always just in general, no. Be very careful. - Yeah, I think it would be irresponsible\nto recommend it to people you don't see. You know? Maybe if you know a\nfriend and the friend asks you, then you could... Maybe I would say\nto a friend, \"Yeah, I think you would be fine taking it.\" But even that is a big\nresponsibility, you know, because LSD in German, the book \"Trip\" is called\n\"The Strongest Substance,\" and it is actually the strongest substance\nbecause it works in microgram dosages. Like, even the strongest snake poison,\ncobra toxin, if you use that in microgram dosages, you don't feel anything.\nBut if you take 250 micrograms of LSD, it can totally overpower you. And if you have an unstable psyche, it could,\nyou know, make, turn you mad, you know? - Do you understand how it compares to\npsilocybin and ayahuasca and DMT? How does LSD compare to those? Is it\nsimilar territory, just more intense? - Well, LSD and psilocybin are like cousins. - Distant cousins or- - No, quite close cousins. And I\nspoke to a neuroscientist from a university clinic in Zurich, who's been\nresearching psilocybin and LSD since the early '90s. And he\nputs people in, uh, in brain scanners, for example. So he sees\nexactly what happens in the brain on LSD or on psilocybin. And he said to\nme when I asked him that very same question, he said, \"LSD\nis the more sophisticated molecule.\" He meant by that is that LSD docks onto more receptors\nthan psilocybin. Like, psilocybin interacts with like five\ndifferent types of receptors in the brain and LSD like with\nnine. So that makes LSD a more complex molecule. So that's why it already works in very small quantities, because\nit's like the key is perfect for our brain. Our brain really reacts strongly to LSD. For psilocybin you have\nto take milligrams, not micrograms, but milligrams.\nSo mushrooms are also described as the softer,\nyou know, psychedelic experience because it only lasts for\nlike five hours, whereas LSD lasts like eight hours. And LSD can be more LSD is also a mushroom, but it's\nan ergot, which is a mushroom, but it's turned into a\ndiethylamide. It's the, you extract the potent acid from ergot,\nwhich is lysergic acid, and you turn that into a diethylamide.\nSo it's a processed drug in a way. It's a potent\nprocessed drug that works also for mass movements quite well. That's why it was\nso popular in the '60s, because people could just make it. While mushrooms, they\nkind of, they have to grow. Like, the hippie movement, they\ncould never have sustained on mushrooms because so many\nmushrooms don't even grow. A good LSD chemist can make LSD\nfor the whole world, basically. - Can we go back to something we talked\nabout in the beginning about Berlin? Is it'd be fascinating to learn more\nabout this culture. Are you still connected? I'm sure you've been to\nsome wild parties. I've been told that Berlin has some wild parties. - Well, it had them in the '90s. I\nmean, it had the best clubs that I... I mean, it was just a dream. You\ngo into this club. But I was also in my mid-20s, so I would go into\nthis club, I'd take MDMA, and the DJ is amazing and the sound\nsystem is crazy, and there's like 500 people on MDMA just\ndancing for like eight hours. - And that's when electronic\nmusic was really— - Yeah, it was really good. Like, a friend\nof mine, he runs a club of visionaries, which is kind of a famous underground club\nin Berlin. And he asked me in the early 2000s when this club was offered to\nhim, \"Should I do this?\" I said, \"Gregor, techno is over, you know, electronic\nmusic is dead.\" But obviously it's not dead, it's still going on,\nbut in the '90s it was new. So it was... You really went into the club\nand you heard something you'd never heard before. And the first time, I came from New York, and\nNew York was a very old-school, kind of urban place. I mean,\nrock and roll or grunge music. And I came to Berlin,\nit was in a club called I Am A Bucket in East Berlin, doesn't\nexist anymore, like, in a rundown, totally rundown, like, squat. And I went\nto the bar and I had a beer, and I looked, and there were just a few people\non the dance floor, and this like electronic music which I'd never heard before.\nAnd the guy in front of me, he was like... He looked like an East\nBerlin skinhead, kinda type of guy, but, like, totally\nsmiling. I'm sure he was on ecstasy, and he was\ndisassembling, like, an imaginary machine. And I just looked at this guy, he\nwas like for one hour, he was just doing the most- most complicated things.\nAnd I was like, this is totally, totally different way of moving,\nand I liked that actually. I liked to dance in clubs. Yeah. And I\ndid this for like two years very intensely with my girlfriend\nat the time. We went out a lot, like, from Friday to Monday, basically. But it means... And a lot\nof people still do that in Berlin, but it means that you can't\nreally work. I mean... - Yeah, you escaped that. It's interesting\nthat you were able to do that for a short time, just as an experience,\nand then go on to be extremely productive. - For me, it was also kind of research,\neven though I didn't know this. - I mean, life is research in a\nway, if you allow it to be. - I could not have written these books\non history and drugs without having had these drug experiences,\nbecause that... I mean, also, like, when I wrote about\nmethamphetamine and the Nazis, I asked... At the time, weed was\nillegal in Germany, so I asked a friend of mine, she's a cannabis\ndealer, I guess you would say. I said, \"Can you also get me crystal meth?\" And she was like shocked,\nlike, \"No.\" 'Cause she was a weed dealer, but then she found like a\nPolish guy who actually had crystal meth. I just wanted to have it. It was like the\nPaul Schrader thing when he wrote the screenplay to Taxi Driver, he\nhad like a gun in his drawer. So he would play, you know, get the vibe of,\nlike, danger. And so I wanted to have this crystal meth. So this Polish\nguy sold it to me, and he gave me without me saying anything. And maybe my friend, maybe she said, \"He's a\nwriter\" or something, but he gave me a Xerox. He gave me the methamphetamine,\none gram, and the Xerox copy of the r- the patent of Pervitin from 1938, so this was a crystal\nmeth dealer that actually had historical- - Mm-hmm. Knowledge, yeah. - ...knowledge about it. So, - Did you, did you ever try? - Yeah, well then I tried it, because I\nreally wanted... I could not really write about it in the same way\nwithout having tried it. I can't recommend it. It feels very\ntoxic, like, when you take a psychedelic. I can say this with a clear\nconscience, it's not toxic. LSD is not toxic, it doesn't\npoison you. You might have reactions in your brain that are\ntoo much for you, but if you snort crystal meth it goes on your\ncentral nervous system, your heart starts pounding, your blood pressure\nrises, so it's stressful on the organism, it's toxic, you know. ... but still, you know, the effect in the\nbrain is not so interesting as with LSD. Like, you couldn't go crazy, I would\nsay, on- on crystal meth, you just have, like, you're just very much awake but you\ndon't have, like, crazy thoughts that you can't, you know, evaluate anymore.\nSo it's a very, very, very different drug, but taking that of course made me\nunderstand better how a soldier feels in the tank taking it. - Yeah. Yeah, I think that's really,\nreally important to do. Um, I- I have to ask, your friend Alex, who's...\nI- th- it sounds like he's taken every single drug there is. Has he spoken\nabout, like, what's the most interesting drug? What's his favorite\ndrug? He seems like a connoisseur, right? - But he's not a psychedelic guy, so. - Oh, well then, okay. - More i- he's more into\nthe addictive drugs. - It's very difficult, I\nguess... Yeah, that would be a special person that can be a\nfull-on explorer of the drug space. 'Cause if you get into psychedelics, then\nyou don't really want to do the hard drugs, really want to do the hard drugs, and if\nyou get the hard drugs you don't wanna- - Right. They contradict each other. - They do contradict each other. Yeah. - It's why we spend less\nand less time together. - Um, Since you mentioned Kerouac.\nListen, I love Kerouac. Do we know any sort of famous writers that\nhave used drugs as part of their writing? So Kerouac is one. - Do we an- do we know any famous writers who\nhave not used drugs as part of their writing? - Interesting. So, wait, I didn't\nactually know, to be honest, this story. I- I love Kerouac- - That's the good thing about being a writer,\nyou can take drugs on the job and no one will cancel you for it. If you're like a\npolitician you can't really do it. - That's right. Rock... You can be a\nrock star or you can be a writer. - Yeah. You can be an artist and take drugs. - You mentioned that Kerouac did what? - Amphetamine. - Amphetamine. - Speed. Basically speed. The\nlegend has it that On The Road was written in two weeks on speed, basically\nwithout sleeping, and using an endless paper roll. - Yeah. The whole scroll. Yeah. - in this typewriter, so he was just writing.\nAnd I can imagine that you can write a hell of a lot on amphetamines,\nand I do it sometimes, but I don't do it a lot,\nyou know. So I can take amphetamines and have a really good time\nand write, like, 20 pages, but then the next day I wouldn't do it anymore.\nBut he decided, \"Okay, for 14 days I'm gonna do it.\" Philip\nK. Dick was an amphetamine writer. And also, I think if you take\na lot of amphetamines, you get into kind of psychedelic spaces at a\ncertain point in time where you start hallucinating, and... like,\nif you write, you know, Blade Runner, maybe it helps you.\nSo amphetamines are also they can be creative, I guess.\nIt's just not, I don't, it's not my type of drug. And they're\ncertainly not as creative as But it also depends on the\nperson. Like, Malcolm Lowry, Under the Volcano, he was drinking a lot. Or Hemingway was drinking a lot, and they\ncould only write when they're drunk. When I'm drunk, I can't\nwrite. I just can't do it. - Write drunk, edit sober. - And that's advisable. Like, if I would\nwrite something on amphetamines, I would certainly edit it\nsober, of course, because on amphetamines, your self-criticism\nis lowered because you feel so good. Like, you feel so confident.\nYou just write, and... But writing is about nuances, especially literary\nwriting. Maybe a non-fiction book would be easy on amphetamines,\nbut a novel, it's all about you have to be very,\nvery open. Amphetamines close you. You become like a\nmachine, like, you write. But if you're on the right track, like Kerouac\nwith On The Road, he had the right, you know, he was on, he was going,\nyou know? But you could also be on the wrong one and then write 200\npages, and you just have to throw it away. And probably he did a\nlot of that also, you know? - Yeah. And also, On The Road\nis a particular kind of book. - It's an amphetamine book. - You want the spontaneity, the speed of... - It's about speed. It's about moving fast,\nbut not stopping. It is a speed book. That's a great book. - It's such a great book. It's such a\ngreat book. But then I've recently been rereading all of\nDostoevsky. So, so going through Notes on the Underground, The Idiot,\nCrime and Punishment, The Brothers Karamazov. And that, I don't think... - Which one's your favorite? - Brothers Karamazov. Well, I read\nin both Russian and English. And for the longest time,\nit was The Idiot. Until ... It's a complicated philosophical\nissue. When I was younger, I thought Prince Myshkin, the main\ncharacter in The Idiot, was not as flawed as I believe he is now. I\nthink Dostoevsky tried to create a Jesus-like character in Prince Myshkin. - Right. - and I think kind of failed because he was, too giving in a way that was\nactually counterproductive and destructive to the world, which is he tried\nto fix in The Brothers Karamazov with Alyosha Karamazov. But anyway,\nI don't think you could do that. I'd be very surprised to\nlearn that Dostoevsky did any drugs. - Also, there was not so much available. - That's true. - Alcohol, of course, nicotine, coffee.\nThose are really powerful drugs. - And I'm also doing a podcast\nwith Chuck Palahniuk, author of Fight Club and many other amazing books. - Yeah, he's a great writer.\nFight Club influenced me quite a bit. I think the novel is even\nbetter, maybe, than the movie. But the movie's great. - I mean, in that case, as he said,\nthe movie is great and that is almost like a bigger than life thing. Sometimes the book and the movie and\nthose things can influence culture. - That certainly influenced culture. - To where, like, \"Okay, this has a\nlife of its own.\" I'd like to think some of your work might influence how\nwe perceive history. That's really important. That's really powerful.\nTo not just change, but to sort of expand our conception of\nhistory, which is important to do. Are there particular\nbooks, fiction or non-fiction? So you were both a fiction writer and\na non-fiction writer. Are there books that had an influence on you? - Yeah, it's Ulysses by James Joyce. Ulysses is good, but only when you're\nin your early 20s, living in New York, and you're writing your first\nbook, and you just have taken LSD. - Oh, nice. - Then I read it, and then it opened... - It made sense? - Well, it just showed, it's just a very experimental novel, so it opens up. You\ndon't have to understand everything, but it shows you that there's many different ways of telling a\ntale, and that was quite interesting to me. But the most influential book,\nmaybe, is \"The Stranger\" by Camus. Because I like the language\nso much, and I'm really mostly interested in language. I\ndon't really care what it's about. I was lying on the beach in Morocco when\nI was 20 and reading \"The Stranger.\" Then a Moroccan came and he said,\n\"Why are you reading a racist book?\" I'm like, \"What are you talking about? This\nis world literature.\" He said, \"Yeah, right. He's like, killing an Arab without\nconsequence. No, actually there's consequence, but no reason, basically. Just\nbecause he's bored. So this is racist.\" bored. So this is racist.\" That was like, made no sense to me, that argument,\nbecause I was just interested in how Camus constructed. It was just for me\na stylistic experience to read that. - I always love books, and \"Stranger\" is\na short book. I love books that are able to accomplish so much in so little,\nin so few pages, in so few words. \"The Stranger.\" - There's nothing unnecessary in \"The\nStranger,\" and I always try to write a book where every sentence is just... There's nothing unnecessary in\nthe book. But it's very hard to do, actually. Nietzsche could do this. Peterson talked about this, that every sentence\nin Nietzsche is like, chiseled, and it's like, perfect. And I think not every-\nI mean, but that's his tendency. He tries to write like this, and that's very\nhard to achieve. That's actually where the writing becomes poetic. So for me,\nNietzsche also is like a poet. The aphorisms are poetry.\nSo Nietzsche also, stylistically, since you asked,\nwas very important to me. So Camus, Nietzsche, James Joyce, and\nthen, and Kafka also. I like Kafka always. And I like Thomas Mann. I don't know how\nwell he translates, but in German, it's interesting his take on how to...\nIt's funny. He's a very funny guy. Even though he talks too much,\nbut he's good. So I always wanted to have these guys as my\ncolleagues, basically. - Mm-hmm. Are they there somewhere\nin your head as you're writing? - Less and less. But it was like an incentive\nto be part of that club. Like, to be able to write a book, and it's\nout there, and it's perfect, and it's... and you are on one level\nwith Camus, you know? It's very hard to do. Let's say you become a carpenter,\nwhich is also, you know, a very challenging job, but you don't have these kind\nof great... Well, you have Jesus, I guess, as your potential colleague. - Yeah, true. - But for the... I just like\nthese writers, these two. So the ones I mentioned, and also\nthen Thomas, Thomas Pynchon. who wrote \"Gravity's Rainbow,\" which I think\nis one of the best novels of the 20th century. And I read that in Berlin in the late '90s, and it really blew my\nmind. I thought it... I think it's an absolute masterpiece.\nThe intensity of this novel, \"Gravity's Rainbow,\" is unparalleled,\nand I'm still puzzled by how he did it. And it's not known how he did it, because\nhe lives... He lives a completely obscure life. No one knows basically who he is. So\nhe's also a very interesting colleague. - It's widely regarded as one of the\nmost challenging and significant works of postmodern literature. - It's pretty good. - Set primarily in Europe at the end of World\nWar II, the novel centers on the design, production, and deployment of the German\nV-2 rocket. The narrative follows several characters. It\nlists the characters. - Well, Slothrop is the American\nagent who's the main character. He works for Allied Intelligence,\nand he's really a funny guy. He smokes a lot of weed and he's, like,\nin Berlin, in bombed out Berlin after the war, and it's just funny\nto go with him through that. He's a great character.\nIt's a great novel. It really is. - So it does, it does give a\nwindow into history also. - It does, yeah. But that's not why\nit's interesting to me. It makes it especially interesting\nbecause the way he describes these situations, it's just the\nway he writes is phenomenal. - Oh, it's a Pulitzer Prize and all. - Oh, but I'm sure he didn't take it. - On lists. - 'Cause, yeah, he declined. Well, no one knows who he is. I\nknow a little bit. I know who his wife is, but I'm not gonna talk\nabout it. He really wants to protect his privacy. And I think that's also amazing. - I think that's a beautiful thing,\nbut for me, from my perspective... - He wouldn't appear in the podcast? - He would not. - It would be great if he\nwould come on the podcast. - He would not, right. Well, I believe it's\npossible, but with people like that, it has to be a long journey, and it has\nto... you have to... for me, for example, I just interviewed Terence Tao, who's\none of the greatest mathematicians, one of the greatest living mathematicians,\nprobably one of the greats in history. And there's another I wanna speak\nwith, which is Grisha, Grigori Perelman, who's a Russian\nmathematician, who's more akin to Thomas Pynchon. He declined\nthe Millennial Prize, the one, one million dollars. He declined all the\nprize Fields Medal, Breakthrough Prize in Mathematics. He declined everything,\nand he just lives with his mom now, quit mathematics. - Like Kirilov, he also lived\nwith his mom. Mm-hmm. - There's something really beautiful\nabout a human being like that. - Right. - Um, especially because in his case it was done for principles.\nLike, he has a certain set of principles, and no amount of money,\nnothing could buy him or ... - Yeah, that's amazing actually. - Yeah. I had somebody tell me this, a really interesting guy I\nmet a few days ago said that there's nothing, there's nothing more\nexhilarating. Perhaps only a rich person can say this, but there's nothing more\nexhilarating than saying no to a lot of money. But he said, he said it with\nso much confidence that I somehow believed him. But the\ndeeper truth there is living by principles and having integrity.\nThere is something deeply fulfilling. If that means\nsaying no to money, or if that means standing up to Hitler,\nand then risking your life, that's a deeply fulfilling thing.\nBig, ridiculous question. I thought you're a good person to\nask. What's the point of this whole thing? What's the meaning of life\nand our existence here on Earth? - I somehow think that the universe has a big story to tell, or\nit's telling a big story the whole time, and our consciousness\nis part of that bigger story. So the consciousness of the whole\nof the universe, the big, the huge story is something that is probably\nthe meaning of life, or the meaning of life, of our individual\nlife, is to understand that story. And that is something, for\nexample, that I understood quite well on LSD when I walked in the mountains\nabout a month ago. Because the mountains, they actually, you know, take you quite high\nup into the atmosphere, and they are made of all kinds of minerals. So they are receiving cosmic energy\nthat comes, you know, that hits our planet. And walking up\nthere, I guess if you're on LSD, you're more open somehow because\nyou're not closing with your default mode network that, you know, this is the tree and this\nis the path and this is the mountain, and now it's 2:00 and I have\nto go back, and the rain. Like, you're more open so you're\nmore, like, perceiving. I... That's at least the impression\nI had. And I couldn't put it in words what exactly I was\nperceiving, but I was perceiving more of the bigger story. And I think that is\ninspiration, and I think those moments bring you quite close to the meaning of\nlife. And I wouldn't put that meaning on life in words. It's an\nexperience, and I think that for me as an artist it was an important\nexperience to make, to get close to that. And, and that is that is what you can achieve in\neach of your professions, you know? Like a mathematician, he comes\nto that point when he, like, sees more or, like, he grasps\nconnections. And he might not be able to put it into a\nformula yet, but if he's an open person, he might be a\nbetter mathematician because he can understand a bit more of\nthe meaning of everything. - Of this bigger story that's being written. - Yeah. I mentioned to you my\nSubstack which I think is going to be the best Substack. - Do you think it's possible it's the\ngreatest Substack of all time in history? - That's what it's going to be. - It's going to be, yeah. - Stoned Sapiens Substack,\nbut something else... - I just hope you actually do it. - Well, you should become a subscriber. - I will definitely subscribe. - I really realized that there is a\ngreater, a bigger story and it's somehow interesting to try to open up. Because if we\nlive... That's why I like to be in nature also quite a lot. You get a better access. We live boxed in. Walter\nBenjamin called us the boxed human beings, like we're living in the\ncities, we're waking up, we're doing... It's good to be, therefore\nit's good to be outside the system. And I hope that my\nart can contribute to, you know, freeing the brainwaves to, you know, understanding a bit more.\nWhat that is, I don't know, but I think the process of understanding\nmore and connecting in different ways, that is what I'm going for because\nI think that is the meaning of life. - Well, thank you for doing that with all\nof your work and for inspiring us all to do the same. Thank you\nso much for talking today. - It was great. Thank you. - Thanks for listening to this conversation\nwith Norman Ohler. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors\nin the description and consider subscribing to this channel.\nAnd now let me leave you with some words from the great Terence\nMcKenna: \"Nature loves courage. You make the commitment and nature\nwill respond to that commitment by removing impossible obstacles.\nDream the impossible dream and the world will not grind\nyou under; it will lift you up. This is the trick. This is what all these teachers and\nphilosophers who really counted, who really touched the alchemical\ngold, this is what they understood. This is the shamanic dance\nin the waterfall. This is how magic is done, by hurling yourself into the abyss\nand discovering that it is in fact a featherbed.\" Thank you for listening,\nand hope to see you next time.",
