  "full_text": "- The following is a\nconversation with Pavel Durov, founder and CEO of Telegram, a messaging platform actively used by over 1 billion people. Pavel has spent his life\nfighting for freedom of speech, building tools that\nprotect human communication from surveillance and censorship. For this, he has faced pressure from some of the most powerful governments and organizations on earth. In the face of this immense pressure, he has always held his ground continuously fighting\nto protect user privacy and the freedom of all of us humans to communicate with each other. I got the chance to spend\na few weeks with him and can definitively say that he's one of the most principled and fearless humans I've ever met. Plus, when I posted that\nI'm hanging out with Pavel, a lot of people, fans of his, wrote to me asking if he\ndoes in fact privately live the disciplined aesthetic\nlife he's known for, no alcohol, stoic mindset, strict diet and exercise, including a crazy amount of\ndaily pull-ups and pushups, no phone except to occasionally\ntest Telegram features, and so on. Yes, he's 100% that guy, which made the experience\nof hanging out with him really inspiring to me. I'm grateful for it, and I'm grateful to now be\nable to call him a friend. This podcast conversation\nis in parts philosophical about freedom, life, human nature, and the nature of\ngovernment bureaucracies, and it is also in part super technical, because to me, it's fascinating that Telegram has a relatively\nsmall engineering team and yet is able to basically out-innovate all of its competitors with an insane rate of\nintroducing new, unique features. Just like the meme of \"The\nSimpsons\" did it first, you consider all the\nfeatures we know and love in our communication apps, in almost every case,\nTelegram did it first. So we discuss it all, from the Kafkaesque situation he's in the midst of in France, to the rollercoaster\nof his life and career, to his philosophy on technology, freedom, and the human condition. And by the way, while\nthis entire conversation is in English, we'll make captions and\nvoiceover audio tracks available in multiple languages, including Russian,\nUkrainian, French, and Hindi. On YouTube, you can switch\nbetween language audio tracks by clicking the settings gear icon, then clicking Audio track, and then selecting the\nlanguage you prefer. Huge thank you once again to ElevenLabs for their help with\ntranslation and dubbing and with the bigger mission of breaking down barriers\nthat language creates. They are truly one of the\nmost remarkable companies I've ever had the\npleasure of working with. This is the \"Lex Fridman Podcast.\" To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, dear friends, here's Pavel Durov. - You've been an advocate for freedom for many\nyears, writing that you should be ready to risk everything for\nfreedom. What were some influences and insights that helped you\narrive at this value of human freedom? - I get to experience the difference\nbetween a society with freedom and a society without freedom pretty\nearly in life. I was four years old when my family moved\nfrom the Soviet Union to northern Italy, and I could see\nthat a society without freedom cannot enjoy the abundance of\nopinions, of ideas, of goods, and services. Even for a four\nor five year old kid, it was obvious. That you can't experience all the toys, the ice cream of sorts, the cartoons in the Soviet Union that you could access\nin Italy. And then I got to realize something even more important.\nYou don't get to contribute to this abundance without freedom. And at\nthis point, it was pretty obvious to me. - You also wrote, \"Svoboda vazhne\ndeneg.\" It translates to: \"Freedom matters more than money.\" How\ndo you prevent these values for freedom corrupted by money, by people with\ninfluence, by people with power? - Well, the biggest enemies\nof freedom are fear and greed. So you make sure that\nthey don't stand in your way. If you imagine the worst thing that can happen to you, and then make\nyourself be comfortable with it, there's nothing more left to be\nafraid of. So you stand your ground, and you remember that it's worth\nliving your life according to the principles that you believe\nin, even though this life can end up being shorter than a longer\nlife, but lived in slavery. - Do you contemplate your mortality?\nDo you think about your death? - Oh, yes. - Are you afraid of it? - In a way, you have to go\nagainst your instinct of self-preservation. And\nit's not easy. We are all biological beings hard-coded to be\nafraid of death. Nobody wants to die. But when you approach it\nrationally, you live and then you die. There's no such thing\nas your death in your life. You stop experiencing\nlife once you die. So you have to ask yourself this\nquestion, \"Is it worth living a life full of fear of death?\" Or, it's much more enjoyable to forget\nabout this and live your life in a way that makes you immune\nto this fear, at the same time remembering that death exists\nso that every day would count. - Yeah. Remembering that death\nexists makes you deeply feel every moment that you do get. - That's why I love reminding\nmyself that I can die any day. - In many ways you live a pretty\nstoic existence. I got a chance to spend a couple of weeks with\nyou. In many ways, you seek to minimize the negative effects\nof the outside world on your mind. You've written, quote, \"If you want to reach your full potential\nand maintain clarity of mind, stay away from addictive substances.\nMy success and health are the result of 20 plus years\nof complete abstinence from alcohol, tobacco, coffee,\npills, and illegal drugs. Short-term\npleasure isn't worth your future.\" Let's talk about\neach one of these. Alcohol. What's been your philosophy behind that? - That one is quite easy.\nWhen I was 11 years old, my biochemistry teacher, he gave\nme this book he wrote, it was called The Illusion\nof Paradise. In there, he would describe the biological and\nchemical processes that happen in your body once you consume this or that\nsubstance. It was mainly related to illegal drugs, but alcohol was one of\nthese addictive substances that he covered. So it turns out that when you drink\nalcohol, the thing that happens is that your brain cells become\nparalyzed. They become literally zombies. And then next day, some time after\nthe party is over, some of your brain cells die and never get\nto normal. So think about this. If your brain is this most\nvaluable tool you have in your journey to success and happiness, why\nwould you destroy this tool for short-term pleasure? This sounds ridiculous. - In many ways, it's a poison we\nlet in our body. But by way of advice, what advice would you give to people\nwho consider not drinking? You know, a lot of people use alcohol to enable\nthem to have a vibrant social life. There's a lot of\npressures from society, you know, at a party to drink so they can socialize. So, what advice\nwould you give to them, To people who imagine having a\nsocial life without alcohol? - Well, first of all, don't be afraid\nto be contrarian. Set your own rules. Secondly, if you feel you\nneed to drink, there must be some problem you're trying to\nconceal. There's something that, some fear you're not ready to confront,\nand you have to address this fear. If there is a good-looking girl\nyou're afraid to approach, get rid of this fear, approach her,\npractice, do it again and again. It's pretty banal... but this advice works. - Fix the underlying problem, which\nis usually at the very bottom is always going to be fear. Work on that. - I don't know. Very often, people are trying\nto escape something in their lives with alcohol. What is it they're\ntrying to escape? What is this problem? You have to get to the bottom\nof it. Your mind is trying to tell you something valuable, and instead of\naddressing it directly, you are flooding it in alcohol, which is sort\nof a spiritual painkiller, but works only temporarily, and then you have\nto pay the debt with interest. - So, what do you do? I mean, you've\nbeen in a lot of gatherings, a lot of parties. Is there some\nchallenges to saying no? - For me, not at all. I've been always ready\nto stand my ground and say no when I feel something's not right. And\nit's extraordinary how easily we humans are affected by what we perceive\nas majority, because nobody since ancient times, since millions of\nyears ago, wants to be left out by the tribe. We are scared that we\nwon't become accepted anymore, which thousands or millions of years ago\nmeant we're going to starve to death. So, we have to consciously\nfight this inclination to be agreeable with everything that\nthe majority imposes on you, because it's quite clear that many things that the majority... in many activities\nthe majority is engaging in are not bringing you any good. - So, that's another fear you have\nto face. Going into a party and the fear of being the outcast at\nthat party, of being different than others at that party, at that\nsocial gathering in the crowd of humans, be different. That's a fear. - That's a fear, and it's quite\nirrational if you think about it. It was something that made a\nlot of sense 20,000 years ago. It makes zero sense today,\nbecause if you think about it, if you do the same thing everybody\nelse around you is doing, you don't have any competitive advantage,\nand you don't get to become outstanding at some point in your life. - Yeah, that's one of the\nthings we talked about sort of by way of advice is, if you want\nto be successful in life, you want to be different. - Definitely. - And perhaps, I think you\nsaid you want to achieve mastery at a niche, so find\na niche at which you can pursue with all your effort\nand achieve mastery, and the niche being\ndifferent than anything that anybody else is doing. Can you\nexplain that a little bit more? - So, obviously, in order to\ncontribute to the society you're in, to the economy\nof the country you live in, you have to do something\nthat is valuable. But if you're doing something that\neverybody else is doing anyway, what's the value of it?\nNow, it sounds easier than it is done to do something\nthat nobody else is doing, because we humans are surrounded\nby all kinds of information which makes us want to copy what we are perceiving. At the same time, there\nare so many areas which you can explore that have nothing to do with the information you receive on\nthe daily basis. So, it's extremely important to curate the\ninformation sources that you have, so that you wouldn't be\nsomebody who is left to the will of AI-based algorithmic\nfeed telling you what's important, so that you\nend up consuming the same information, the same stuff, the same\nmemes, the same news as everybody else. But rather, you should be\nproactive. You should deliberately try to set a goal an area that you want to\nexplore, and then actively search information that is relevant to\nthis field, so that one day, you can become the world's number one expert in this field. And it's\nnot quite... it's not that difficult to do that. You have to just remain consistent, because\nnobody else is trying to do that. Everybody else is just reading\nthe same news and discussing the same news every day. But this way, they don't\nget to have a competitive advantage. - Yeah. The majority of the\npopulation become slaves to the AI recommender systems, AI-driven\nrecommender systems, and so the content everybody's fed is the same\nthing, and we all become the same. On that point, one of the\ndifferent things you do is you don't use a phone, except\noccasionally to test Telegram features. But I've been with you for\ntwo weeks. I haven't seen you use a phone at all in the way that most\npeople use a phone, like, for their social media. So, can you describe\nyour philosophy behind that? - I don't think a phone is\na necessary device. I remember growing up, I\ndidn't have a mobile phone. When I was a student at the\nuniversity, I didn't have a mobile phone. When I finally got\nto use a mobile phone, I never used phone calls. I was always\nin airplane mode or mute. I hated the idea of being disturbed. My philosophy\nhere is pretty simple. I want to define what is important in my\nlife. I don't want other people or companies, all kinds of\norganizations telling me what is important today and what I should be thinking about. Just\nset up your own agenda, and the phone gets in your way. - It provides distractions.\nIt guides what you should be looking at, what you will be looking\nat, so you don't want that. You want to quiet the mind. You want to choose what\nkind of stuff you let inside your mind. - Yes, because this way I can contribute to the progress of society, or at\nleast I like to think this way, and this makes me happier. - How often do you find quiet time\nto just think and focus deeply on work without any distractions? You mentioned\nto me that you value quiet mornings. - Yes. So the thing I'm trying to do, I\ntry to allocate as much time as possible for sleep. Now, even if\nI allocate, say, 11 or 12 hours for sleep, I won't\nsleep for 11 or 12 hours. So what I end up doing is I end up lying in bed thinking, and\nsome people hate it. They say, \"Oh, you have to take a sleeping\npill,\" but I never take pills. I love these moments. I get so many brilliant ideas, or at\nleast they seem brilliant to me at the moment, while I'm lying in bed, either late in the evening or early in the morning.\nThat's my favorite time of the day. Sometimes I wake up, I go take\na shower, still without the phone. Beautiful ideas can come to you while you're doing your\nmorning exercise, your morning routine, without a phone. If you\nopen your phone first thing in the morning, what you end up being\nis a creature that is told what to think about for the rest\nof the day. Same is true in a way if you've been consuming news from\nsocial media late at night. But then how do you define\nwhat is important and what you really want to become\nin life? Now, I'm not saying you have to completely stay\naway from all sources of information, but take some time\nto think about what's really important for you and what you\nwant to change in this world. - So you definitely try to avoid digital devices\nfor as many hours as possible in the morning, just to have the quiet thinking\ntime? Plus the crazy amounts of push-ups and squats. - I know it's kind of\ncounterintuitive because I founded one of the largest social\nnetworks in the world, after which I founded the second-largest\nmessaging app in the world, and you're supposed to be\nreally connected. But the conclusion you reach very early\nis that the more connected and accessible you are, the\nless productive you are. And then how can you run this\nthing if you're constantly bombarded by all kinds of information,\nmost of which is irrelevant to the success of what you're trying to build? You\nknow, the entire world can be fascinated by a fight, a quarrel between\nthe world's richest man and the world's most powerful man. But\nfor the vast majority of these people following this saga, it's irrelevant.\nIt won't change their lives. And in any case, they can't affect it, so\nit's a bit pointless. Of course, there are people who are engaged in activities that require them to be up-to-date\nof everything that's going on, but 99% of people aren't. - Yeah. The internet, social\nmedia presents to us drama in such a way that we think it's the biggest\nthing in the world, the most important thing in which the tides of history will\nturn when in reality, most things will not turn the tides of history.\nAnd so, I guess our challenge is to figure out what is\nthe timeless thing? What is the thing that's happening today that's\nstill going to be true in 10, 20 years? And from that, decide what you're going to do. And\nthat's very difficult on social media 'cause everybody's outraged. The news\nof the day, whatever the quarrel is, that's the thing that everyone\nthinks the world will end because of this thing, and then another\nthing happens the next day. - And they're trying to\ninfluence your emotions. And that's how you get into trouble, because\nyou can be forced to make conclusions that are not in your best interest. - I've seen you be, once again,\nquite stoic about your emotions. Do you ever get\nangry? Do you ever get lonely? You ever get sad?\nThe rollercoaster of human emotion. And what do you do with that?\nWhat do you make difficult decisions? - I'm a human being like everybody\nelse. I do get to experience emotions, and some of them\nare not very pleasant. But I believe that it's the\nresponsibility of every one of us- ...to cope with these\nemotions and to learn to work through them.\nSelf-discipline is particularly important, because without\nit, how can you overcome this seemingly endless\nloop of negativity or despair that ultimately leads to depression\nfor some people? I normally never have depression. I don't remember\nhaving depression in the last 20 years at least, maybe when I was a teenager.\nBut one of the reasons for that is, I start doing things. I identify the\nproblem, I can see a solution, and I start executing the strategy. If\nyou are stuck in this loop of being worried about something,\nnothing's ever going to change. And people often make this mistake,\nthinking, \"Oh, I should just have some rest and then\nregain energy.\" This is not how it works. You gain energy by doing something. So if you start doing\nsomething, then it happens. You feel motivated, you feel inspired,\nand then ultimately you do something else, a little bit more, a\nlittle bit more, and in a few years, who knows, you may end up\nachieving great things. - Yeah, that's the thing that people\nreally confuse. If you're stuck in a depressive cycle,\neven when you really, really, really, really don't\nwanna do anything, just do something. Try to make progress\nbecause the good feeling comes in the end of that. The whole point is to do\nfirst and then feel, not feel and then do. - Exactly. And going to the\ngym is a good example. There are many days when you\ndon't want to start working out, but you have to overcome\nthis initial reluctance, and then you get to a point that\nyou enjoy it, and you think, \"Oh my God, it was such a good idea\nto come to the gym today.\" But it's similar to pretty much every\nactivity. You get to write some code, write a small\npiece of code first, and then you get inspired.\nThen you come up with more ideas. You need to write a novel\nor just write the program. This is pretty obvious, and it's not a secret, but because\nwe are bombarded with all kinds of information that is not really\nimportant for us in terms of becoming successful, we often forget the important\nthings, and this is one of them. - We've been working out every single day.\nYou have been working out for many years pretty intensively, so I think\na lot of people would love to know what's your perfect\ndaily workout regimen, let's say on a daily, on a weekly basis? - I do 300 push-ups and 300\nsquats every morning, and in addition to that, I go to\nthe gym normally five or six times a week, spending between\none and two hours every day. - So push-ups and squats are still\na big part of your routine? - Yes, this is how I start\nmy day. I'm not sure they do a lot in terms of changing your body,\nbut they're definitely a good way to practice self-discipline, because you don't want to do these\npush-ups in the morning most of the days. Squats are particularly\nboring. They're not that hard. They're just boring. But you\novercome it, and then it's much easier to start doing other things related\nto your work, for example. When I can, I also take an ice bath\nbecause it's another exercise of self-discipline. I think the main\nmuscle you can exercise is this muscle, the muscle of\nself-discipline. You know, not your biceps or your\npecs or anything else, because if you get to train that one,\neverything else just comes by itself. - Yeah, everything else becomes easy.\nWe should mention, I went with you to Banya, and I think it's\nfair to say you're nuts in terms of how much you\ncan handle, and I didn't even see the worst of it. Can you just\nspeak to your crazy escapades in the Banya, what value you get from it, so\nboth the heat and the cold? - I don't know if it's crazy. I think it's\nquite natural and normal by this time. But maybe I just got used to it.\nSo Banya is this extreme kind of sauna practiced by Eastern Europeans. But it is done in a way that\nmaximizes heat, and they also use all kinds of herbs and branches, and\nit's a much more holistic and natural experience. Then a necessary\npart of it is you get the cold plunge, and then you go back. And again, this is one of those\nthings that maybe in the moment is not always that pleasant,\nparticularly if you go to extreme temperatures. You don't\nfeel great. I don't always feel great, but this feeling is\npassing. It's only a few minutes. Same with the ice bath.\nYou have to suffer a bit, and then you get to feel great\nfor hours and days after. What's more, it gives you these\nlong-term health benefits. In a way, you can look at it as alcohol in reverse. Alcohol will give\nyou this short, fleeting pleasure for an hour, for a couple of\nhours, but then you will be paying for it with long-term negative consequences.\nI'd rather do Banya and ice bath. - We swam the length of a large lake\nin France a couple times. Can you talk through why you value\nthese multi-hour swims? - I love swimming for hours. The longest\nI swam was five and a half hours in Finland, it was quite cold.\nI got lost in the process, barely could find my way back. But the reason I do it, yes, you feel\ngreat after. You're shaking a little bit, but you feel great after. We\ncross a huge lake, and I cross many lakes, Geneva Lake, Zurich Lake. And\nevery time, you feel this achievement which makes you happy, makes you\nfeel strong, and then you're more ready to other challenges. And of\ncourse, when you know you are going to start a journey that will last a few\nhours, you're reluctant to do it. But you swim for 10 minutes, and then\nfor 20 minutes, and then for 30 minutes, and it teaches you this\nincredible patience that I think is necessary if you\nwant to achieve anything in life. - And it's pretty meditative,\nlake versus ocean. - Yes. And you don't have to go too fast.\nYou can be slow and enjoy the moment. - Until you get lost, and it's five and a\nhalf hours. Did you panic if you were gonna be able to find the\nshore or find your way out? - Not really. I'm a reasonably stress-resilient\nperson. I didn't panic at that moment, and there were worse swims I\nhad that were shorter, but involved accidents, and you\nknow about some of them. So that wasn't the worst by\nfar. But an important thing about swimming and physical activity in\ngeneral is that it makes your mind clear, and your thinking process is becoming\nmore efficient. Because at the end of the day, the efficiency of our brain is\nlimited by how much sugar and oxygen our heart can push through blood to\nour brain. So how can you make this go faster, or how do you make your\nlungs more efficient? How do you make your heart more efficient in\ndoing that? Physical activity is the only way I know of. So\nit's not just staying healthy or trying to look good. It's also\nbeing productive. It's also being stress-resilient. All of these qualities are necessary if you want to run a large\ncompany, if you want to start a company. I'm surprised, when I started doing this more than 10 years ago, that more\nCEOs didn't engage in sports. The situation changed in the\nlast several years, which is great. Because back in the day, if you take\n20 years ago, there was this stereotype that if you were strong, you\nmust be not very smart, and vice versa, which is complete lunacy. Very\noften, these two things go together. - So for you, working out is not just about staying\nhealthy. It's actually valuable for the work that you do as a tech leader, as an\nengineer, as a technologist? - Oh, yes. When I can't\ntrain, I can instantly feel that stress is creeping on me. Like... So even in situations where I'm\nconstrained, I can't go to the gym, I just keep doing push-ups.\nI just keep doing squats. - Yeah. I mean, that's the cool thing\nabout bodyweight exercise, you can just do it anywhere.\nYou could just pop off 50 or 100 push-ups before a meeting. - Don't you feel weird when you have\na day without physical activity? - Yeah. If I go a day without doing\npush-ups, at the very minimum, that's a shitty day. - And if you can do pull-ups,\nit's even better. - Yeah. I gotta ask you about\nyour diet, too. No processed sugar, no fast food, no soda,\nintermittent fasting sometimes once a day only, sometimes a\ncouple times a day. So take me through your philosophy on the no\nsugar, no soda, just clean food. - Well, sugar is pretty easy,\nbecause it's addictive. The more you consume sugar, the more\nyou want it, the hungrier you get. So if you want to stay\nefficient and healthy, why consume processed sugar? You'll\njust end up snacking all the time. Intermittent fasting,\neating only within six hours or not eating for 18\nhours every day also brings structure into your day and\ninto your eating habits, so you don't crave sugar anymore. Because,\nyou know, if you eat sugar and then you're unable to snack, you're just\npunishing yourself. I read a few books on longevity. I think something\neverybody agrees on is that sugar is harmful. Now, I'm not militant about\nsugar. You can eat berries, fruit, if you feel your body needs it.\nBut it's not true to think it's necessary to consume\nsweet things, not for children, not for adults. Red meat, I stopped eating it about 20 years\nago, because I just felt heavy every time I had it. So I\nguess it's individual. It's my metabolism, my digestive system\nisn't agreeing with this kind of food. So I normally eat seafood of\nall kinds and vegetables. This is the basic source of calories for me. - Yeah, and like all things you\nsaid, short-term pleasure isn't worth your future. So, a lot of things we\nall know, that alcohol is destructive to the body, tobacco, pills, processed food, sugar.\nBut society puts that on you, makes it very difficult to avoid. So, I guess\nit all boils down to just discipline. - Yes, and trying to identify the\nreal cause of an issue you're experiencing. If you're experiencing a\nheadache, one solution would be to take a pill, and then the headache disappears.\nWhat this pill would actually do, in most cases, it would mute the consequence,\nyour feeling of pain. It's a painkiller. It will not eliminate the root\ncause, so you have to ask yourself, \"What is it that is causing\nthis headache? Do I need to drink some water? Is the air quality here bad?\nDo I need to start getting more sleep? Is there something\nwrong with people around me that are stressing me out?\" There\nmust be some reason why you're experiencing a headache.\nBut if you take a pill, you're not removing this reason. You're\nactually making it worse, because this harmful factor is still there. It's\nlike you're piloting a helicopter, and there are some red signals,\nsome red lamps start to blink and it starts producing bad, unpleasant noise. What would you do?\nYou would try to figure out the cause and eliminate\nit. Maybe there is some mountain next to you and you have\nto avoid it, or you take a hammer and smash the signal. I think the good answer is quite\nobvious. So, why are we constantly doing this regardless? Well, because everybody\nelse is doing it, because there's a whole industry trying to persuade\nyou that this is the right thing to do. So it's incredibly important to analyze yourself and try to\nget to the bottom of things. - So, you generally try to avoid all\npills, all pharmaceutical products? - Yes. I've been staying away\nfrom all of that since I became an adult. When you're a\nteenager, your mom would typically say, \"We need to take this pill,\notherwise, you know, the world collapses.\" Once I became a grown-up, I said, \"No, I\ndon't think that the producers of pills are incentivized in the right way.\"\nThey are not really interested in eliminating the root of the problem.\nThey would rather have me dependent on the pills they're producing\nso that I could buy them forever. And then I also\nrealized... No, I'm not saying that you should never take pills.\nThere are obviously some diseases that you can only fight with\nantibiotics, for example, so I'm not suggesting we go\nback to the Middle Ages. But what I'm saying is we overuse pills. - Yeah, it's always good to study and deeply\nunderstand the incentives under which the world operates so that you don't get swept up into\nthe forces that operate under these incentives. And big pharma\nis certainly one of them. Pharmaceutical companies\nhave a huge incentive to keep the problem going versus solving\nthe problem. It's wise. - Well, this is something\nI practice every day. I read some piece of news, and I ask myself,\n\"Who benefits from me reading this?\" then you can end up coming\nto this conclusion that maybe 95% of things we read\nin the news have been written and published because somebody\nwanted you to buy some product, support some political cause, fight some\nwar, donate some money, just do something that would benefit other people.\nAnd this is not a problem to support causes that\nyou truly believe in, as long as it was your intentional choice,\nand you're not being manipulated into fighting other people's wars. - And that takes us back to the original\nthing we started talking about, which is freedom. One of the ways to\nachieve freedom of thought is to remove your mind from the influences, the\nforces that manipulate you. That's really important to realize. The content you consume, especially on the internet,\nwhen a large percentage of it is designed to manipulate your mind,\nyou have to disconnect yourself and be very proactive, understanding\nwhat the bias is, what the incentives are, so you can think clearly,\nindependently, and objectively. - And again, it ties back with\nrestraint from alcohol. Because if your mind is\nclouded, how can you analyze yourself? You'll always be\ndependent on opinions of others. You will always follow the mainstream, and w- then whatever the authorities\nor whoever in charge will tell you, you'll believe it,\nbecause you don't have a tool of your own to rely on to\ncome to your own conclusions. - I have to ask you, this is something\nthat came up. You don't watch porn. I don't think I've heard you\ntalk about this before. What's the philosophy behind not watching porn? You\nknow, there's a lot of people that talk about porn in general having a\nvery negative effect on young men, on their view of the world, on their\ndevelopment of their sexuality, and how they get into relationships, and\nall that kind of stuff. So what's your philosophy in not consuming porn? - I don't watch porn because\nI just feel it's a surrogate, a substitute\nfor the real thing that is not necessary in my life.\nIf anything, it just forces you to exchange some energy, some inspiration, to a fleeting\nmoment of pleasure. It doesn't make sense. And i- in any case, as I said, it's not the real\nthing. So as long as you can access the real thing,\nyou don't need to watch porn. But then, if you can't\naccess the real thing, it's... you shouldn't watch\nporn as well, because it means there's some deficiency in your life,\nsome problem that you have to overcome. - Yeah, analyze the underlying cause. And again, this goes back to\nthe theme of investing in a long-term flourishing versus\nshort-term pleasure. There's a theme to the way you approach life. - I try to be strategic. I try to act under the assumption that I'm not\ngoing to die in one hour from now, and I'm going to stick\naround for a bit, despite the fact that we are all\nmortal. So why would I exchange the mid and long-term for the\nshort-term? Doesn't make any sense. - Quick pause, bathroom break. - Yeah, let's take a break. - All right, we took a break, and now we're\nback. I gotta ask you about Telegram, the company. I got to meet some of the\nbrilliant engineers that work there. Telegram runs lean. Relative\nto other technology companies that achieve the scale that\nTelegram does, it has very few employees. So how many people are on the core team,\nlet's say the core engineering team? - The core engineering team is\nabout 40 people. This includes backend, frontend designers,\nsystem administrators. - Can you speak to the philosophy behind\nrunning a company with so few employees? - Well, what we realized\nreally early is that quantity of employees doesn't translate\nto quality of the product they produce. In many cases, it's the opposite. If you have too many people, they have\nto coordinate their efforts, constantly communicate, and 90% of\ntheir time will be spent on coordinating the small pieces of work\nthey're responsible for between each other. The other problem with having\ntoo many employees is that some of them won't get\nenough work to do. And if they don't get enough work to do, they\ndemotivate everybody else by their mere existence. They're still there,\nthey're still getting the salary, but they don't do\nanything. And if they don't do anything, more often than not,\nthey will start trying to find their purpose elsewhere,\nmaybe inside your team, but not by doing productive work, but\nby finding problems that don't exist within the team. And that\ncan disrupt the team and the mood inside it even\nfurther. Also, when you intentionally don't allow\nsome of your team members to hire more people to help them, they\nwill be forced to automate things. In our case, you know, we have tens of thousands of servers around the\nworld, almost 100,000, distributed across several continents and data centers.\nIf you try to manage this system manually without automation, you will probably end up hiring thousands\nof people, tens of thousands of people. But if you rely on algorithms\nand the team is forced to put together algorithms in order to\nmanage it, then it becomes much more scalable, and much more efficient, and\ninterestingly, much more reliable as well. - And more resilient to the\nchanging geopolitics, to the changing technology, all of\nthat. Because if you automate the distributed aspect of\nthe data storage and all the compute, then that's going to be resilient\nto everything the world throws at you. I suppose if you have people managing\nall of it, it becomes stale quickly. - Yes. Humans are attack vectors. And\nif you have a distributed system that runs itself automatically, you have a a chance at increasing the security\nand speed of your service. and speed of your service. This\nis what we did with Telegram, while also making it much more reliable. Because if some part\nof the network goes down, can still switch to the other parts of it. - Yeah. One of the big ways\nto protect user privacy is that you store the data. The\ninfrastructure side of Telegram infrastructure side of Telegram is\ndistributed across many legal jurisdictions many legal jurisdictions with the decryption\nkeys. So it's encrypted in the cloud, keys. So it's encrypted in the\ncloud, the decryption keys are split and kept in different locations so\nthat no single government or entity entity can access the data. Can you\nexplain the strength of this approach? - The way we designed Telegram is we never wanted to have any humans,\nany employees have any access to private messaging data. That's why since 2012,\nwhen we've been trying to come up with this design, been trying to come up with this design,\nwe always invested a lot of effort invested a lot of effort into making\nsure that nobody can mess with it. into making sure that nobody can mess\nwith it. Like if you hire an employee employee or any of the existing\nemployee, they can't break the system they can't break the system in a way that\nwould allow them to access messages of users. access messages of users. And then of course,\nwe launched end-to-end encrypted messaging end-to-end encrypted messaging that is even\nmore protected, but it has certain limitations, but it has certain limitations, so you still have\nto rely on encrypted cloud. So an interesting encrypted cloud. So an interesting engineering challenge was how do you make\nsure that no point of failure can be created that no point of failure can be\ncreated within your team or outside? - So no employee can even access user messages. So\nthat's the thing. You know, we talk about encryption, thing. You know, we talk about encryption, we talk about\nprivacy, we talk about security, all these kinds of things. all these kinds of things. I think the number one thing\nthat people are concerned about, about which there's also about which there's also misinformation, is about\nprivate messages. So Telegram is very, very protective private messages. So Telegram is very, very protective\nof the private messages of users. So you're saying saying employees never can\naccess the private messages. Have any governments or intelligence agencies\never accessed private user messages in the past? agencies ever accessed private\nuser messages in the past? - No, never. Telegram has never shared\na single private message with anyone, a single private message with anyone, including\ngovernments and intelligence services. including governments and intelligence services. If\nyou try to access any server in any of the data center data center locations, it's all encrypted.\nYou can extract all the hard drives and analyze it, but you won't get anything. It's\nall encrypted in a way that is undecipherable. It's all encrypted in the\nway that is undecipherable. That was very important for us.\nThat's why we can say with confidence there hasn't been ever a leakage of\ndata, any leak of data from Telegram. Not in terms of private messages,\nnot in terms of, say, contact lists. - Do you see in the future a possible scenario\nwhere you might share user private messages where you might share user private messages\nwith governments or with intelligence agencies? - No. We designed the system in\na way that it's impossible. impossible. It would require us to change the system,\nand we won't do that because we made a promise to our and we won't do that because\nwe made a promise to our We would rather shut Telegram down\nin a certain country than do that. - So that's one of the principles\nyou operate under: you're going to protect user privacy. - I think it's fundamental. Without the right\nto privacy, people can't feel fully free and protected. - I mean, this is a good place to ask.\nI'm sure you're pressured by all kinds of people, all kinds\nof organizations to share private data. Where do\nyou find the strength and the fearlessness to say\nno to everybody, including powerful intelligence agencies, including\npowerful governments, influential powerful people? - I guess part of it is just\nme being me. I stood up for myself and for my values\nsince I was a little kid. I had issues with my\nteachers because I would point out their mistakes during\nclasses. And at the end of the day, what's important is to remind\nyourself that you have nothing to lose. They can think they blackmail you with\nsomething, they can threaten you with something. But what is it they really can do to you? Worst case, they can kill you. But that brings\nus back to the first part of our discussion. But that brings us back to the\nfirst part of our discussion. There's no point living your life in fear. As for Telegram, it's\nincredibly successful. But if we lose one market or two markets,\nor pretty much all of the markets, I don't care that much. It won't affect\nme, it won't affect my lifestyle in any way. I will still be doing\nmy push-ups, you know? So... You don't like encryption, you\ndon't like privacy, you think you should ban encryption in your\ncountry, like the European Union is trying to do now for\nall the member states. Well, go ahead and do\nthat. We'll just quit this market. We won't operate there. It's\nnot that important. They all think that somehow we profit from their citizens\nand the only goal tech companies have is extracting revenues. And it's true,\nmost tech companies are like this. But there are projects like\nTelegram which are a bit different. And I'm not\nsure they realize that. - So for you, the value of\nmaintaining your integrity in relation to your principles is more important than anything else.\nAnd of course, we should say that you also have full ability and\ncontrol to do just that because you, Pavel Durov, own 100% of\nTelegram. So there's nobody else with a say on this question. - There are no shareholders,\nwhich is quite unique. - Very unique. I don't think there's anything\neven close to that in any major tech company. - And this allows us to\noperate the way we operate. build this project and\nmaintain it based on certain fundamental principles which, by the\nway, I think everybody believes in. I think the right to privacy is included in the constitution\nof most countries, at least most Western countries. But\nit's still under attack almost every week, and\nit often starts with well-meaning proposals: \"Oh,\nwe have to fight crime. We have to do that. We have to protect\nthe children.\" But at the end of the day, the result is the\nsame. People lose their right to such a fundamental thing as privacy.\nThey sometimes lose their right to express themselves, to assemble,\nand this is a slippery slope that we witnessed in pretty\nmuch every autocratic country, or country that used to be\nfree and then became autocratic. No dictator in the world ever said, \"Let's\njust strip you away from your rights because I want more power to myself and I want you to be miserable.\"\nThey all justified it with very reasonable-sounding justifications,\nand then it came in stages, gradually. And after a few years, people\nwould find themselves in a position when they're helpless.\nThey can't protest. Every message they send is monitored.\nThey can't assemble. It's over. - So you see Telegram as a place\nthat people from all walks of life, from every nation can have a place to speak their mind, to\nhave a voice. In the context, in the geopolitical context\nthat you're mentioning that governments when they become autocratic,\nnaturally it's the way of the world, human nature and the nature of\ngovernments, they become more censorious. They begin to censor, and\nalways justifying it in their minds perhaps assuming\nthat they are doing good. - Perhaps some of them assume\nthey are doing good, but interestingly, it always results in the\nstate accumulating more power at the expense of the individual. And then\nwhere does it stop? You know, we humans are not very good\nat finding the right balance, and in this case, the\nright balance between chaos and order, between freedom and\nstructure. We tend to go to extremes. - I think you still consider yourself a\nlibertarian. There is something about government that always, over time,\nnaturally builds a larger and larger bureaucracy, and in that\nmachine of bureaucracy, it accumulates more and more power. And\nit's not always that some one individual member of that bureaucracy is the one that corrupts the initial principles\non which the government was founded, but just something over time, you forget.\nYou begin to censor. You begin to limit the freedoms of the individual,\nthe ability of the individuals to speak, to have a voice, to vote.\nIt just gradually happens that way. - And the government is not some\nabstract notion. The government consists of people, and these people\nhave goals. They would naturally be inclined to increase\ntheir level of influence, to have more subordinates,\nto have more resources, and that's how you end up in an endless\nloop of, you know, ever-increasing taxes, ever-increasing regulation,\nwhich ultimately just suffocates free market, free enterprise,\nand free speech. So, you do want to have very, very strict\nlimitations on the extent the government can increase its\npowers at the expense of citizens. Ironically, you\ndon't have those limitations. You're supposed to, in all countries\nwhich are considered to be free. It's supposed to be the Constitution\nthat protects everybody, but interestingly, it doesn't always\nwork this way. They are able to find very tricky phrasings in order\nto carve out exceptions, and then the exception becomes the rule. - On this topic, I'd love to talk to you about the\nrecent saga of you being arrested in August of last year in France.\nI think I should say that it's one of the worst overreaches of power\nI've seen as applied to a tech leader in recent history, in all history. So it's tragic, but I think\nspeaks to the thing that we've been talking about. So\nmaybe can you tell the full saga what happened? You\narrive in France... - I arrived in France last year in\nAugust just for a short two-day trip, and then I see a dozen armed policemen\ngreeting me and asking me to follow them. They read me a list of something like\n15 serious crimes that I'm accused of, which was mind-boggling. At first, I\nthought there must be some mistake. Then I realized they're being serious, and they're accusing me of all possible\ncrimes that the users of Telegram have allegedly committed, or some users. And they\nthink I should be responsible for this, which again, like you said, is something\nthat never happened in the history of this planet. No country, not even an authoritarian one, did that\nto any tech leader, at least at this scale. There are good reasons\nfor that, because you're sacrificing a big part of your economic growth\nby sending these kinds of messages to the business and tech\ncommunity. So they put me in a police car, and I found\nmyself in police custody. A small room, no windows.\nJust a narrow bed made of concrete. I spent\nalmost four days there. In the process, I had to\nanswer some questions of the policemen. They were interested\nin how Telegram operates. Most of it is public\nanyway, and I was struck by very limited understanding, or should\nI say, even a lack of understanding on behalf of the people who initiated\nthis investigation against me about how technology works, how encryption\nworks, how social media work. - I mean, there's something darkly\npoetic about a tech founder of a platform where a billion people are\ncommunicating with each other, and you're on concrete, no pillow, for days, no windows. It's like a book. I mean,\nit reminds me, I'm a huge fan of Franz Kafka, and he's written about\nthe absurdity of these kinds of situations, hence the Kafkaesque\nstories. There's a story literally about the situation\nthat he wrote, perhaps predicted, called \"The Trial,\" where a\nperson is arrested for no reason that anybody can explain\nand is stuck in the judicial system for a long time. Fascinatingly,\nin that story, neither the person arrested nor any individual\nmember of the system itself fully understands what is happening.\nNobody can truly answer the questions, and eventually the person,\nspoiler alert, is mentally broken by the whole system, which is\nwhat bureaucracy can do in its most absurd forms. It breaks the spirit,\nthe human spirit latent in all of us. That's the negative side of bureaucracy. - I agree with you on the absurdity of\nthis thing, because if this was a good faith attempt to fix an issue, there were so many ways\nto reach out to Telegram, to reach out to me personally,\nvoice their concerns, and solve any alleged problem in a way that is\nconventional and diplomatic, the way every other country on this\nplanet solves its problems, including with Telegram, and\nwe did it dozens of times. - Yeah, you have a nice page showing this.\nThis is kind of like details that most people don't really think about. But\nTelegram was at the forefront of moderating CSAM and terrorist groups. There's\na nice page, telegram.org/moderation, that shows just the incredible\namount of groups and channels that are engaged in\nterrorist activity and CSAM activity that are blocked,\nactively blocked, found and blocked by Telegram. And a lot of this work,\nlike you said, because of the automation that's done with machine learning,\njust the scale is insane. This is stuff that most noobs like me who are\njust chatting it up on Telegram don't think about. But there's\njust an immense number of people essentially doing\nthings that violate the law on there, and you have to find\nthem immediately and catch it. I guess all platforms have to deal with it,\nand Telegram was doing a great job of dealing with that kind of content. And what\nyou're saying is the French government had no idea. - Do they even know what\nmachine learning is? - It's a concept that is\nchallenging to explain to them, but I think they will learn much\nmore about it by the end of this investigation. That's my hope. In any case, you're right. I mean, if you\nlook at Telegram, we've been fighting harmful content that is publicly\ndistributed on our platform since 10 years ago, actually, since the time we launched public\nchannels on Telegram. And since something like eight years ago,\nwe had daily transparency reports on how many channels related to\nchild abuse or terrorist propaganda we've taken down daily. Every day, we've\ntaken like, maybe hundreds of them. And if you include all kinds of content\nthat we remove, all the accounts, groups, channels, posts,\nthat would amount to millions of pieces of content every\nweek, hundreds of thousands every day. And then somebody would read\nthe newspaper, get enraged because they would read something about\nchild porn, and this is a subject that is very emotionally charged, and start\ndoing something not based on data and logical thinking and laws, but based\non emotions driven from inaccurate input. - Yeah, I think we should make it pretty clear\nthat there's no world, no reason that the French government should have arrested you,\nbut here we are. That's the situation you're in. So to be clear, you have\nto show up in front of a judge. Now all of this is beautifully\nabsurd. It would be hilarious if it wasn't extremely serious. You have to\nshow up in front of a judge every certain amount of time. And\nwhat is that experience like? - In France, they have this role of\ninvestigative judge. I don't think you have it in many other places in the\nworld. It means I'm not on trial, I'm being investigated. And in France, it's not just the\npolice or prosecutor asking me questions, it's a judge, which,\nin my experience, is more like still a prosecutor, but it's called a judge,\nand that makes it harder to appeal. So if you're limited in, say,\ncountries where you can travel, then to appeal that restriction\nwill take you a lot of time. The investigation itself should have never\nbeen started. It's an absurd and harmful way of solving an issue as complicated as regulating social media.\nIt's just the wrong tool. So we objected and\nappealed the investigation itself. We did last year, I\nbelieve. We're still not even given a hearing date for the appeal, because\nthe process is painfully slow, not just for me but for\neverybody, which made me realize the system may be\nbroken on many levels. You have other entrepreneurs affected\nby the French justice system telling me horror stories about\ntheir experiences, where businesses got paralyzed by very unnecessary actions\nof investigative judges that ended up being unjustified and biased. And in\nthe end, you can perhaps solve it when you reach a higher court and you'll get justice, but you'll lose\na lot of time and energy in the process. So this is the only thing\nthat is, I hope, different, and will be different in this case\ncompared to the story you told from Kafka. - I mean, but it does, as Kafka\ndescribes, break a lot of people with time. So when do you hope...\nWe should say that you were for a long time not allowed\nto travel out of France. Now you can travel to Dubai.\nWe're now in Dubai. Got to meet many of the people\nthat work at Telegram. Telegram is headquartered in Dubai. But\nyou're not allowed to travel anywhere else. When do you think you're coming to\nTexas to hang out with me over there? - That's a hard question to answer because\nit doesn't depend on just my actions. I can just say this: I am patient. I\nwill not let this limitation on my freedom dictate my actions. I will,\nif anything, double down on defending freedoms because I experienced firsthand\nwhat the absence of freedom feels like, at least during those four days in\npolice custody when you are stuck, just stuck, unable to\ncommunicate with people that are important to you. When you don't\neven know what's going on in the world in relation to you personally.\nSo I have no crystal ball that would tell me the future.\nI can't say that I'm pessimistic. I think we've\nbeen able to gradually remove most of the restrictions initially\nimposed on my freedom last August. - If the French government or\nthe French intelligence agency want to have a backdoor to\naccess private user messages, what would you say to them? Is there anything they can do to get access\nto the private user messages? - Nothing. My response would\nbe very clear... but it won't be very polite, so I'm not sure. - It's good to say here. - It's good to say because\nyou're wearing a tie and- - Yeah. This is a serious\nadult gentleman-like program. But it is a concern\nthat people have is when you have so much pressure from\ngovernments, that over time, they'll wear you down and you'll give in.\nAnd then, of course, other places use that as propaganda, try to attack you.\nYou get attacked by basically every nation. So it's a difficult medium in which to operate. It's\ndifficult to be you, fighting for freedom, fighting to preserve people's\nprivacy. But is there something you could say to reassure people that\nyou're not going to sacrifice any of the principles that\nyou've just expressed? If the French government just\nkeeps wearing you down? - I think the French government is losing\nthis battle. This battle is wrong. The more pressure I get, the more\nresilient and defiant I become. And I think I have proven\nthat in the last several months, when there were attempts to use my\nsituation, being stuck here in France, by approaching me and asking me to do things in other countries,\nblocking certain channels, changing the way Telegram\nworks. And not only I refused, I told the world about it, and\nI'm going to keep telling the world about every instance any government, in this case, in\nparticular, the French government, tries to force me to do anything. And I would rather lose\neverything I have than yield to this pressure, because if you submit to this pressure and agree\nwith something that is fundamentally wrong and violates the rights\nof other people as well, you become broken inside. You\nbecome a shell of your former self on a deep biological and spiritual level. So, I wouldn't do that. There are probably\nother people in the world that would consider that, but I don't care. Telegram\ndisappears, too. Something people don't understand, including in these intelligence\nservices or governments. I don't care. I'll be fine. If they put\nme into prison for 20 years, which, let's be clear, it's not something\nthat I think is realistic, but let's just think about it as a\nhypothetical situation, I would rather starve myself to death\nand die there, reboot the whole game, than do something stupid. - Let me ask you about an example of the thing\nyou're talking about. Tell the saga of Telegram in the Romanian\nelection. So, amidst all this, you are still fighting\nto preserve the freedom of speech. What happened, and what were\nsome of the decisions you had to make? - So, when I got stuck in France, unable to\nleave the country for a few months, I was offered to meet the head of state foreign\nintelligence services through a person I know quite well. He's actually a well-known tech entrepreneur in France,\nand he's well-connected, and he said, \"This guy wants to meet you.\" I\nsaid, \"Okay, fine. Let's do that, but I'm not promising anything.\" I\ntook the meeting, and in this meeting, I was asked to restrict what\nI see as restriction of freedom of speech in Romania. I don't know if you\nfollow the whole saga with the Romanian elections. They had presidential\nelections last year. The results were- got canceled. Now, Romania, at that point when I\nhad this meeting, was preparing for a new presidential election. The\nconservative candidate was not somebody who the French government was\nsupportive of, so they asked me whether I would be shutting\ndown, or ready to shut down, channels on Telegram that supported\nthe conservative candidate, or protest against the pro-European\ncandidates, so they called the guy they liked. I said, \"Look, if there is no violation of the\nrules of Telegram, which are quite clear, you can't call to\nviolence. But if it's a peaceful demonstration, if it's a peaceful debate,\nwe can't do this. It would be political censorship. We protected\nfreedom of speech in many countries in the world,\nincluding in Asia, in Eastern Europe, in the Middle East. We're not\ngoing to start engaging in censorship in Europe, no matter who's asking us.\" I was very clear to the guy who\nwas the head of French intelligence. I said, \"If you think that because I'm\nstuck here, you can tell me what to do, you're very wrong. I would\nrather do the opposite every time.\" And in a way, that's what I\ndid. I um... had a small debate with him about the morality of this,\nthis whole thing, and then at a certain point, just\ndisclosed the content of this entire conversation, because I never\nsigned an NDA. I don't ever sign NDAs with any people like that. I want to\nbe able to tell the world what's going on. And that's quite shocking to me, that you would have people in the French\ngovernment trying to get an advantage of this situation. Of course,\nif, you know, they had nothing to do with the start of\nthis investigation itself, and use it to reach their political\nor geopolitical goals. I consider it an attempt to humiliate\nmyself personally and millions of Telegram users\ncollectively. And it's quite strange that the same agency asked us to\ndo certain things in Moldova as well. do certain things in Moldova as\nwell. So even before that, I think it was October of\nlast year, or September. I was arrested in Paris in late August, and then again approached through an\nintermediary, and asked, \"Would you mind taking down some channels in Moldova?\nBecause there is an election going on, and we're afraid there's going to be\nsome interference with these elections. Could you please connect with the\nrepresentatives of the government of Moldova and take care of it?\" We said, \"We're\nhappy to take a look at it and see if there is content there that is in violation\nof our rules.\" And they sent us a list rules.\" And they sent us a\nlist of channels and bots. bots. Some of them were... So\nit was a very short list, and some of these channels and bots were in violation indeed of our rules, and\nwe took them down, only a few of them. The rest were okay. Then they said,\n\"Thank you,\" and sent us another list of dozens of channels, many, many channels. We looked at these channels, we realized\nthat there is no solid foundation to justify banning them, and we\nrefused to do that. But interestingly enough, the French intelligence services\nthat were asking us to do this in Moldova let me know through their contact that after Telegram banned\nthe few channels that were in violation of our rules in\nMoldova, they talked to my judge, the investigative judge\nin this investigation that is started, is has been started against me, and told the judge good things\nabout me, which I found very confusing, and in a way shocking, because these two matters have\nnothing in common. Why would anyone talk to an investigative judge that\nis trying to find out whether Telegram did a good enough job in removing illegal content in France?\nWhat does Moldova have to do with it? I got very suspicious at that moment.\nRemember, it happened after we blocked a few channels that\nviolated our rules, but before we refused to block a\nlong list of other channels that were completely fine, which\nis people expressing political views, which I may not agree with,\nbut it's their right to express them. Not extreme views, not views\nthat call to violence. That was extremely alarming.\nThat was a moment when I told myself that there may be more going on here that I initially\nthought. Initially, I thought, \"Yeah, some people are confused about\nhow technology works.\" And here, after this case in Moldova, I got much more suspicious. So by\nthe time the head of intelligence services met me to ask about Romania,\nto help them silencing conservative voices in Romania, I was already\nwary of what could be going on next. - Yeah, so clearly this was a systematic attempt to pressure you to censor\npolitical voices that the French government doesn't agree with. And we\nshould say that you have fought for freedom of speech for left-wing groups\nand right-wing groups, it really doesn't matter. So it's not, you don't have a political affiliation, political\nideology that you fight for. You're creating a platform that, as long as\nthey don't call for violence, allows people from all walks of life, from all\nideologies to speak their mind. That's the whole point. And it happens to be\nconservative voices in the Romanian election that the French government\nwanted to censor, because currently the French government leans left. But\nif you flip everything around and the government would be\nright-wing, you'd be fighting against censorship of left-wing voices. And\nyou have in the past, many times. - Exactly. Ironically, we\nreceived a request from the French police to take down a channel\nof far-left protesters on Telegram in France. We refused to do that. We looked\nat the channel, peaceful protesters. It doesn't matter for us whether we're\ndefending the freedom of speech of people leaning right or leaning left.\nDuring COVID, we were protecting activists that were organizing\nthe Black Lives Matter events, and the other side,\nthe protesters against lockdowns. We protect\neverybody as long as they are not crossing the lines and not starting to call to violence or\nincite damage to public property. It's a fundamental right\nto assemble. It's interesting that people who haven't had this\nexperience of living in countries that don't have freedoms\ndon't always realize how dangerous it is to\ngradually compromise your values, your principles,\nyour freedoms, your rights, because they don't\nunderstand what's at stake. - Yeah, these things become a\nslippery slope. So for many, many years, including currently, you have\nspoken very highly of France. You love French history, French culture. I think\nthis situation, this historic wrong that's been done is simply just\na gigantic PR mistake for France. There's no\nentrepreneur that aspires to be the next Pavel Durov to create\nthe next Telegram, sees this and wants to operate in France\nafter seeing this. There is no justification for this arrest,\nthere's a misapplication of the law, all kinds of pressures, all kinds of behavior that seems politically motivated,\nall that kind of stuff, all the excessive regulation and bureaucracy. A\nnightmare for entrepreneurs that dream to create something impactful\nand positive for the world. So what do you think needs to be fixed about\nthe French government, the French system? And then zooming out, because\nyou have seen similar kinds of things in Europe that could enable\nentrepreneurs, that could reverse the trend that we\nseem to be seeing in Europe that is becoming less and less\nfriendly to entrepreneurs. What can be fixed? What should be fixed? - I think the European society must decide\nwhere they want the ever-increasing public sector to stop\nincreasing, what they think should be the right size of government.\nBecause today, if you take France, for example, which is a beautiful country\nwith a lot of talented people, but public expenses are 58% of\nthe country's GDP. It's maybe as much or more than in the\nlatest stage of the Soviet Union. So you have this balance\nwhere you have many more people representing the state as opposed\nto people trying to bring the country's economy forward by creating great\nproducts and great companies. The startup field, in my field, social media\nfield, has been affected by it immensely. There was one great startup in this realm\nin France in the last 10 years. It was a location-based social\nnetwork. It was eventually sold to Snapchat, but before it was\nsold, the founder asked me whether he should sell. I told him, \"Never sell. You have a great thing\ngoing. You have lots of users. You have organic traction\nin many countries.\" And the first of this kind\nof success story in France. But then he sold anyway in a\ncouple weeks. And later, I met him, he's trying to do a new thing\nnow. I met him and I asked him, I was trying to understand what went wrong.\nAnd one of the things he told me about is that while he was trying to run his\ncompany, you know, competing with Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, having\nall this pressure from investors, trying to hire the best\npeople and persuade them to go to Paris, and he did a great job, by the way.\nBut while he was trying to do that, he got also attacked by some silly\ninvestigation, again involving data protection issues, which lasted forever, and\nwas gradually sucking the blood of his team and his company,\nconstant interrogations, disclosure requests. And\nthis is a young company. It significantly increases the\nlevel of stress, and at some point, I think the pressure was too much.\nHe decided, \"I'm going to just sell it.\" Eventually, it turned out that there was no issue. The investigation\nended, as far as I understand, with no charges. But such investigations,\nthey have a price, they have a cost. And unless the\nsociety realizes the cost of projects, of companies, of startups that are never created, or are sold to\nthe United States at the very early stage, or other countries, resulting\nin decreased economic growth, things won't change. I think we\njust talked to a guy a few days ago who left France and started a business\nhere in Dubai, and one of the reasons he had to leave France is that\nthe government started an investigation on his company, and they froze his\nbank accounts, and this investigation that involved taxes lasted for many,\nmany years. I believe he said eight years. And at the end of these eight years, the government reached\nthe conclusion that there was nothing wrong. \"He's good.\nIt's okay.\" In the meantime, his corporate bank accounts\nwere frozen. His business died. The only reason why he was able to retain sanity is because he\nmoved to Dubai and started a new company, which is incredibly\nsuccessful, and now he's enriching this city, which we're in right\nnow, with his great ideas and creativity. - And by the way, having interacted\nwith him, there's like a fire in his eyes, the\nhuman spirit that fuels entrepreneurship. Whatever that is, he\ndoesn't have to do. He's made a lot of money. He probably doesn't have to do\nanything, but he still wants to create. And that fire's what fuels great\nnations. Build, build, build, build new stuff, expand, all of that,\nand regulation suffocates that. - You have to cherish those people. But I guess the French public, or\nsome part of the French public, was misled, and I don't know\nwhen, perhaps since the time of the French\nRevolution, to believe that entrepreneurs are somehow their\nenemies. They're the evil rich people that are the cause of all\nproblems, as if only you could make the rich share their\nill-gotten wealth with the rest of the population, then every\nproblem will be magically solved. In reality though, a\nlot of these people, that are starting such companies with\nfire in their eyes, are sacrificing their lives, their\nlivelihood. They're working 20 hours a day. They're experiencing immense\nstress in order to fulfill their vision and bring value and good to\nthe society around them. They create jobs. They create great\nservices. They create great goods. They make your country\ngrow. They make your people proud. You have to cherish them. But what does the system do to them? It\nsqueezes them out, because, perhaps there was somebody in the tax authority that\ndecided to advance their career, and perhaps, you know, was\ntoo ambitious and not too smart, so as a result, the company was destroyed. And now the same\nentrepreneur, by the way, who we talked to, is invited to\ncome back to France. He's being offered really good terms. He\nsaid, \"Are you gonna open this new venue on the Champs-Élysées?\nWe're gonna give you the best location. We're gonna fund\npart of it, tax breaks.\" And he said, \"Never.\nJust forget about it.\" \"It's impossible. I'm not\ncoming back to France.\" He's traumatized by the experience,\nand he's French. He was born there. He has a French passport. So, unless things like this\nchange, France will, and the rest of Europe, will keep\nstruggling with economic growth, with budget deficits, with unemployment,\nand all the other relevant social and economic metrics. - Yeah, it's heartbreaking.\nAs many of these nations, I appreciate the historic and the\ncultural value, and I hope Europe and France flourish, but these are\nnot the components required for flourishing. Quick pause, I need a\nbathroom break. All right, we had some tea. We're back. Let's go back a bunch of years to the\nbeginning. You mentioned you went to school with a super intensive\neducation. So, I thought it'd be really interesting to look at some of\nthe powerful aspects of that education, from the languages\nto the math. Can you actually describe some of the rigorous aspects\nof it and what you gained from it? - At the age of 11, I got\nthe opportunity to enter an experimental school in\nSt. Petersburg where I lived, and we had to pass a\nrigorous test to get accepted. The idea behind the school was\nthat if you try to squeeze as much information as possible\ninto a brain of a teenager, making a focus on math and foreign\nlanguages, then there will be some changes in the brain\nof the student that will allow the student to understand most\nother disciplines. But we had a class as a result that didn't\nhave any single focus. It was very widespread across\na lot of disciplines. You would have at least four foreign\nlanguages, including Latin, English, French, German. In addition, you can get Ancient Greek. You would have classes like\nbiochemistry or psychoanalysis, evolutionary psychology. The difference of this class\nas opposed to other classes in the same school, which was part of the\nSaint Petersburg State University and called Academic Gymnasium, was that unlike other classes, which\nwere specialized in some single subject like physics or math\nor history, this one tried to get the best from all of these\nspecialized classes and bring it into one curriculum. Since it was\nan experimental class, it wasn't possible to become a straight-A\nstudent, to be excellent in all the subjects. It was considered\ncrazy to even try. - So just assume nobody's able to handle it,\nyou're just pushing the limits of the human mind. Four languages in parallel, math, evolutionary psychology, just overwhelming\nthe mind and see what happens. - Yes, see what happens.\nThis was an experiment. And it was in the middle of\nthe '90s, remember, when Russia, particularly its\neducational system, wasn't regulated as much as it is today. It was in the middle between the\ntwo stages of the Russian history, the Soviet's history\nand the modern Russian history of the 21st century. In any case, I learned\na lot from that experience. First of all, why I got into this\ncourse is because I kept being kicked out from other schools. - Challenging authority? - I was good at all subjects, but not\nbehavior, you know. We had this behavior grade in the\nSoviet Union, in early '90s. Perhaps they even\nhave it today, I'm not sure. I was very bad at behavior. Always challenging the teachers, always\npointing out their mistakes. - By the way, that's not such a bad\nthing, right? Like, if you were looking back, there's some value to\nthat, right? For young people to, maybe respectfully, but challenge\nthe authority, the wisdom of old, right? - I think I was very lucky\nto be able to do that and to be able to get\naway with it in the end. Because normally if you keep\nchallenging authorities, you just get kicked out of all\nschools, and then you end up nowhere. So I eventually\ngot into a school where challenging teachers\nwas not fully okay, but it was something that you could\ndo and then you would start a debate with the teacher, and normally they\nwould allow you to express your point of view, and then some objective truth\nmay come out of it as a result. But at that point, I was\npretty bored with my life, you know? Every teenager gets to a\npoint when they have this sort of existential crisis. What's the point\nof life? What am I even doing here? At some point, I decided since\nI have to go to school anyway, I might as well try to do something\nimpossible and become the best student and get an A, or what we\ncalled five in the Russian system, on every single subject. And\nthat kept me busy for a while. It was incredibly difficult because\nyou didn't have enough time. Even if you just studied all the time, not doing anything else, you didn't have\nany time left to prepare all the homework tasks and get ready for\nall the tests. So I ended up using the breaks\nbetween classes, but I got to the result I wanted to get\nto. I got the excellent mark in every subject, and that\nkept me happy for a while. - What did you understand about an effective education system from studying\nforeign languages at the same time, doing such a diversity? Like, if you were\nto design an education system from scratch for young people, especially in the\n21st century, what would that look like? You posted about the value of\nmathematics as a foundation for everything. - Yeah, I still think math is\nessential. It's something that shapes your brain. It teaches you to rely\non your logical thinking to split big problems into smaller parts, put them in\nthe right sequence, solve them patiently, trying again if it doesn't\nwork. And this is exactly the same skill you need in programming, in project management, and start it\nwhen you start your own company. And it's one of the few subjects\nin school which encourages you to develop your own thinking\nas opposed to rely on what other people have to say and just\nrepeating their opinions. That is extremely valuable. And of course, once you're good\nat math, you can apply it in physics, in engineering, in coding. And\nit's not surprising there that most of the most successful tech founders\nand CEOs are very good at math and coding because ultimately, it's the same\nmental skill that you rely on. But back then in the school, I realized\nsomething else as well: it's that competition is really important. Competition\nis key. This is what motivates a lot of teenagers when they're at school. And if you\nremove competition out of the education system, you will end up forcing kids\nto start competing elsewhere, for example, in video games. It's a trend you see now in many\ncountries, including in the West, when well-meaning authorities or\nparents say, \"We don't want our kids to be too stressed. We don't want them\nto feel anxiety. So let's just get rid of all the public grading\nsystem, all these rankings of who won, who\nlost. We don't want any of that.\" And part of it is\njustified, but as a result, some kids lose interest. Yes, you eliminate the losers, but you end\nup eliminating the winners as well. And then if you're overprotective of\nthe kids in that age, they grow up, graduate schools or universities, and\nthey are still not prepared for real life because real life is constant\ncompetition for jobs, for promotions, for customers, and it's more brutal.\nWhat you have as a result is high suicide rates, high\nunemployment, all the things and negative trends\nyou see now in many countries which thought eliminating\ncompetition from their education systems was a good idea, they still persist. They still think\ncompetition's a bad thing. They try to eliminate competition from their economy\nas well to an extent, saying, \"We're gonna make sure the losers don't lose and\nthe winners don't get too much.\" But as a result, they make\ntheir entire systems less competitive, their entire\neconomies. Some of them in Europe are now struggling to keep\nup with China, with South Korea, with Singapore, with\nJapan, and other places where the education system was based on\nruthless competition. So this is a hard choice any civilization has to make. We support competition, understanding\nthat eventually it leads to progress in science and technology\nand abundance for society at large. Or we remove competition thinking that\nsomehow we can shield the future generations from the stress that\ncompetition inevitably causes. - Yeah, I mean, it's grounded in a good\ninstinct of compassion. You don't want people who are, who suck at a thing to\nfeel pain, but it seems like struggle is a part of life. Either\nyou do it early or you do it later. And it's true, that's such a\ngood point that competition does seem to be a really\npowerful driver of skill development, like you\nmentioned, pursuing mastery. There's something in human nature\nthat, especially for young people, if you can compete at a thing,\nyou're gonna be really driven to get good at that thing. If you can direct that\nin the education system as China does, as many, as many nations like you\nmentioned do, then you're going to develop a lot of brilliant people,\nresilient people, people that are ready to create epic\nstuff in the world. - I think there is a lot of evidence\nproving that we are biologically wired to compete and establish\nour understanding of what our qualities are and talents are\nin relation to other people around us. And this is one of the ways\nsociety self-regulates. - Speaking of competition,\nyour brother, Nikolai, he's a mathematician, programmer, expert\nin cryptography. He has won the IMO, International Mathematics\nOlympiad. He got gold medal three times, ICPC Programming two times,\nhas two PhDs in mathematics. And you have worked together for\nmany years, creating incredible technologies that we've been talking\nabout. So what have you learned about just life from your brother? - Well, first of all, I must\nsay I learned pretty much everything from my brother, everything I\nknow. Because when we used to be kids, we slept in the same bedroom, like\nbeds a few feet away from each other. and I kept bugging him with questions.\nI would ask him about dinosaurs and galaxies and black holes and Neanderthals, everything I could think\nof, and he was my Wikipedia back in the time when we didn't\nhave internet access. He's a unique prodigy kid,\nprobably one in a billion. He started reading at the\nage of three, I think, and he pretty fast got so\nadvanced in math that by the age of six, he could\nalready read really sophisticated books on astronomy. Sometimes when\nhe did it in public places like buses or metro, my mom was criticized\nby people who were witnessing it. They would tell her, \"Why are you\nmocking your own kid with this serious book? It's obvious\nthe kid can't understand everything there. It's too complicated.\nEven we don't understand anything there. There are some formulas.\"\nAnd he was already sucking in this knowledge.\nHe just has this thirst for information. So, he was\nthe source of all kinds of great facts, useful\nthings, inspiring things. He taught me pretty much\neverything I know. At the same time, he is incredibly\nmodest and kind, and this is something I think a lot of people that think they're smart but not\ngenuinely intelligent, lack. More often than not, people who are\ntruly intelligent, they're also kind and compassionate. - And he is that. - Definitely. - You actually have been staying out of the\npublic eye for the most part. You've done very few interviews. You're pretty\nlow-key. But your brother is on another level. He's been staying out\nof the public eye. What's behind that? - Part of it is his natural modesty.\nHe doesn't need to do it. He doesn't feel this urge to\nshow off, brag about stuff. I tried to avoid it as well, but at\na certain point, I realized that me being too private, too secretive, becomes a liability because it creates\nthis void, this emptiness that people and organizations that don't like\nTelegram very much are willing to fill with inaccurate information, and\nthey're willing to spread narratives about Telegram, which can result in strange situations, some of\nwhich we discussed earlier, for example, this French investigation. - Yeah. I've gotten to know you\nmore and more, and there's a deep integrity to you that I\nthink is good to show to the world. There's a lot of attack\nvectors on user privacy, and I think the most important, the last wall of protection is the actual\npeople that are running the company. So it's important to some degree for you\nto be out there, showing your true self. So we should say that also you didn't\nmention, but you're a programmer From an early age, you started\ncoding at 10. First things you built were a video game at 11, and then eventually 10 years later, at 21, you\nprogrammed the initial versions of VK single-handedly. Can you talk\nto me about your programming journey that led to the\ncreation of VK? What was the VK stack? Was it PHP mostly? How did you\nfigure out how to program websites, all of that? - I wasn't interested in programming websites\nat first. I didn't even have access to the internet when I was 10\nyears old. But I liked video games. I didn't have enough of them,\nand the scarcity forced me to start building them, more computer\ngames just to play myself. It's actually an interesting thing that we sometimes don't realize\nit, but scarcity leads to creativity, and one of the reasons\nyou have so many people who love to code coming from the Soviet\nUnion or other places which didn't have much access to modern\ntechnology, and more importantly, modern entertainment, is that perhaps we were not\nso much distracted by all this abundance of different entertainment options,\nwhich is not to say it's bad to have those options. It's just a fact that we sometimes don't appreciate.\nSo I started to build computer games. My brother would sometimes guide me. For\nexample, I would create this turn-based strategy, of course two-dimensional. Back\nthen, three-dimensional was too much for me. But it wasn't as slick in terms of\nthe scrolling FPS, frames per second, parameter, and asked my\nbrother how to optimize it. He would guide me, and\nthis kind of learning and training really shaped my coding skills\nwhen I was younger. Then I started to create video games for\nmy classmates. When we played, for example, tic-tac-toe\non an infinite field in my class during the breaks, you know,\nand not tic-tac-toe, the three in a row. This was a bit five in a\nrow, and an infinite field. This is a much more interesting game, and it gets quite complicated\nif you keep playing it. My classmates used to\nlove it, and some of my classmates were really smart,\nyou know, champions of math Olympians, sons and daughters\nof professors at the university, and I decided, \"No, I\nwant to win every single time.\" I don't want to lose even a single time,\nso how do I win? I need to practice more. But how do I practice more?\nI need an opponent stronger than myself. So, I coded this\ngame so that I would play against the computer,\nand the computer would calculate, I think, four moves\nin advance to choose the optimal strategy. That wasn't enough, four moves in advance. I would still\nwin over it. If I tried to calculate five or six, it was too\nslow. So, I asked my brother, \"Help me out here.\" So, he made\nthis algorithm. Eventually, I trained myself to win every single\ntime, even with the computer back then. We didn't have modern CPUs\nand I could still retain some self-confidence. I would go back to school\nduring breaks, play with my classmates, and soon people started to lose interest.\nNone of my classmates wanted to play this game anymore. I killed the\ngame. There's no- So after that, when I got into St. Petersburg State University, it was quite boring just to\nstudy because it was too easy. So, I thought, \"What can I do\nthere?\" I created a website for the students of my faculty first. I\norganized the creation of digital answers to all exams and a digitized\nversion of all lectures, which was something very unique back then.\nRemember, it was 25 years ago. I would put together a\nwebsite where I would publish all these materials, and\npretty soon it became super popular. I opened a discussion forum\nthere. In a few years, I expanded to the university with all of its other departments, and then to other\nuniversities. We ended up having tens of thousands of users just as a\nstudent support tool. We had all kinds of social features there: friends lists, photo\nalbums, profiles, blogs, all of it. It was quite successful, and after\nI graduated the university, one of my ex-classmates from the school reached out to me after\nreading about my successes in a newspaper, the main\nbusiness newspaper of St. Petersburg, and he asked me,\n\"Are you trying to build a Russian Facebook?\" I said, \"I'm\nnot sure. What's Facebook?\" So, we met. He, since he graduated in American university two years before that,\nhe showed me Facebook. I thought, \"Well, I kind of already have all of this\ntechnology, but it's valuable to know which elements I should get rid\nof in order to scale this thing and have millions of users.\" This is also\nsomething people don't appreciate that sometimes in order to move forward\nand have more success, you have to get rid of things, including technology.\nGetting rid of features is super important. - Simplify, both for\nscaling and for making it amenable to just growing the user\nbase where people get it immediately. - Yes. Otherwise, it's just too\ncomplicated for the new user. The existing users will be happy.\nThey'll be praising you. They'll be asking you to add more stuff to make it\neven more complicated. So, it's easy to lose track and get disoriented if you are\nonly relying on the feedback of existing users. As a result, I started\nthe website called Vkontakte, or VK. It means \"in touch\"\nin Russian. Initially to solve my own personal\nproblem, I graduated the university that same year and I\nwanted to be in touch, remain in touch with my ex-classmates from the university and\nother fellow students. And of course, as a 20-year-old, other fellow students. And\nof course, as a 20-year-old, I wanted to meet other people,\nincluding good-looking girls. So, I started to build it\nfrom scratch. For that one I thought, \"I'm not going to\nuse any third-party libraries, modules because I want to make it as\nefficient as possible.\" I was obsessing over every line of code. But then how do you start something that\nlarge? Like, I didn't have any prior experience of creating a project\nof that scale, which would involve everything. Before, I\nwould reuse some existing solutions. Here, I wanted to build\nfrom scratch, so I called my brother. He was a postdoc student in Germany at the time in the Max Planck\nUniversity, and I asked him, \"What should I start from?\"\nAnd he told me, \"Just build a module to authorize users.\" Just\nnot a way to log in, you know? Not even to sign up, just to log in, because you can pre-populate the\ndatabase with credentials and emails and passwords. It doesn't really\nmatter, but once you see that you can type in your password and email and\nyou're in, and it tells you \"hello\" using your name. Then you will have a clear\nunderstanding where to go from there. - Yeah, I mean, that's true. - That's one of the best advice\nI've ever got in my life. It worked perfectly, by the way. I\nstarted to build it and before I knew it, there on that website,\nphoto albums, private messages. This guest book\nwe used to call \"the wall\" back on VK and, I guess, in\nthe early days of Facebook, we ended up building something\neven more sophisticated than Facebook at the time, with more features. I had a girlfriend at\nthe time, I asked her, \"We need to somehow come up with a database\nof all Russian schools and universities and their departments and\nsubdivisions.\" She did a great job trying to source all this information\nonline or sometimes writing emails to universities saying,\n\"Which departments do you have exactly at this point?\nWe need to know,\" or reaching out to the\nDepartment of Education, both in Russia and then\nin Ukraine, and then eventually in Belarus, in Kazakhstan,\nand other countries where VK ended up to be the largest and most popular social\nnetwork. So we did a few things that were quite unique at the time, and for the\nfirst almost a year, I was the single employee of the company. I was the\nbackend engineer, the frontend engineer, the designer. I was\nthe customer support officer. I was the marketing guy as well, coming up with all the wordings\nand the announcements, coming up with competitions to promote VK, which worked quite well. That\nwas an incredible experience that gave me knowledge of every aspect\nof a social networking platform. - Also, an understanding of how\nmuch a single person can do. - Exactly. It's one of the reasons\nwhy I like to think I'm an efficient project manager and product\nmanager inside Telegram, because I will not take anything but ambitious\ndeadlines from my team members. If somebody gives me, \"Oh, I need three weeks to\ndo that.\" I would reply, \"Well, I built the first version of VK in just\ntwo weeks. Why would you need three weeks? It seems like something you could make real in just three days.\nThree weeks? What are you going to do the rest of the three\nweeks apart from those three days?\" And, you know, the team\nknows me, and that's why we are able, today at Telegram,\nto move at a very good pace of innovation every\nmonth. We're pushing several meaningful features, I think,\nout-competing everybody else in this industry in terms of what you can do within a short timeframe.\nSo yes, that experience was invaluable. As for the\nstack, I started from PHP and MySQL, Debian\nLinux, but very soon I realized I needed to optimize\nthis. I started using Memcached. Apache servers were not\nenough anymore. We had to set up NGINX, and my brother was still living in\nGermany, so he couldn't help me much for the first year of building VK.\nSometimes I would manage to get through to him through a call. I would use an\nold-school phone to call him with wires and say, \"What do I do? How do I install\nthis thing called NGINX? I'm not a Linux guy.\" If he felt particularly kind that day and not too\nbusy, he would show me the way to do it or set it up himself, but for the most\npart, I had to rely on just myself. Having him there, though, helped when\nwe started to grow fast and scale it, because at first you realize, \"Right now, one server is\nnot enough. I need to buy another one, then another one and another\none. The database should be in a different server. Then you have to split the database into tables.\nThen you have to come up with a way to shard the tables using some criteria that would make sense,\nthat wouldn't break your user experience. When we got to over a million users and beyond, a\ndozen servers surviving without the input from my\nbrother in terms of taking care of the scaling aspect of it, became\nimpossible. I remember asking him to come back. I said, \"You need to help\nme with this thing. It's starting to be really big.\" What was worse is that since we became popular,\nsomebody started to do DDoS attacks on us,\nas it always happens. - Right. - And then we had people that\nwanted to buy a share of VK. And interestingly, every time we had\na negotiation day, the DDoS attacks intensified. So we had\nto come up with a way to fight it. I remember having many\nsleepless nights trying to figure it out. - So that was your introduction to\nall kinds of bad actors, DDoS, business. Then later you'd find out\nthere's such a thing called politics, and then later geopolitics. But this is\nthe initial stages. That it's not just about creating cool stuff.\nIt's having to deal with, as you now have to deal with\nwith Telegram, is seas of bad actors trying to test the limits of the\nsystem, trying to break the system. - Unfortunately, if we didn't\nhave bad actors and pressure, it would be the best job\never. You just get to create. - Yeah. Yeah. And so the help from your brother, like you mentioned, NGINX and\nsharding the tables, some of the scaling issue is algorithmic in nature. It's\nalmost like theoretical computer science. So it's not just about, like,\nbuying more computers. It's figuring out how to algorithmically make everything\nwork extremely fast. So some of it is mathematics. Some of it is pure\nengineering, but some of it is mathematics. - Yeah, so at that stage I could\ndo the basic stuff. I could understand how I implement scalability\ninto the codebase, how I sharded my tables in the database, where I include\nMemcached instead of direct requests to the database.\nThat was quite easy because it was still PHP back in\nthe day. When my brother got back from Germany somewhere around 2008, I asked him, \"Can we make it even\nmore efficient? Can we make it super fast, and at the same time\nso that we would require even fewer servers to maintain the load?\"\nAnd he said, \"Yes, but, you know, PHP is not enough. I'll have\nto rewrite a big part of your data engines in C and C++. I said,\n\"Okay, let's do that.\" He invited a friend of his to help him, another\nabsolute champion in world's programming contest\ntwice in a row, and they they put together the first\ncustomized data engine, which was far more efficient than just relying\non MySQL and Memcached, because it was, first of all, more\nspecialized, more low level. - So they rewrote it in C, C++? - A large chunk of it, like,\nfor example, the search, the ad engine, because VK had\ntargeted ads. They built that. It was, it was very efficient\nwhat they did. Eventually the private messaging part,\nthe public messages part. At some point, we realized there are very\nfew websites online that load faster than VK. - Nice. - I remember in 2009, I\nwent to Silicon Valley and I met Mark Zuckerberg the first time\nand some of the other core team members of, of early Facebook.\nRemember, Facebook was just four or five years old then.\nAnd everybody kept asking me, \"How come even here in\nSilicon Valley, VK loads faster than Facebook? Everything seems to appear instantly on your\nwebsite. What's the secret sauce?\" It was one of the things\nthat made them very curious. - And that was always important to you to have\nvery low latency to make sure the thing loads and... because that's one of the things\nTelegram is really known for. Even on crappy connections and all that kind of stuff,\nit just works extremely fast. Everything is fast. - It's one of the core technological\nideas. We prioritize speed. We think that people can notice the difference even if it's\njust, like, 50 millisecond difference. The difference is subconscious.\nIt also allows us not just to be faster and more responsive, but also\nmore efficient when it comes to the infrastructure, the expenses, because if your code executes\nfaster, it means you need fewer computational resources\nto run it. So there is no way you can lose in making things\nfaster, and that's why we have always been very careful when hiring\npeople. I would only hire a person if I'm ultimately certain it's the best\noption. Because if you hire somebody who is maybe a little bit distracted,\ninexperienced, you may end up with inefficiencies in your codebase\nthat results in tens of millions of dollars of\nlosses. And think about the responsibility. If we jump to today\nfrom the VK days, Telegram is used by over a billion people. They open\nit dozens of times every day. Imagine the app opens with\na slight delay, say half a second delay. Multiply it by dozens\nof times by a billion. It's... centuries, millennia lost for\nhumanity without any reason other than just being sloppy. - That is so important to\nunderstand and so wise, that if you're just a little\nbit careless as a developer, you can introduce inefficiencies that\nare going to be very difficult to track down, because you don't know that\nit can be faster. The code doesn't scream at you, saying, \"This could be\nmuch faster.\" So you have to actually, as a craftsman, be very careful\nwhen you're writing the code and always thinking, \"Can this be done\nmuch more efficiently?\" And it can be tiny things, because they\nall propagate throughout the code. And so there's a\nreal cost in having a careless developer\nanywhere in the company. Because they can introduce that inefficiency,\nand all the other developers won't know. They'll just assume it kind\nof has to be that way. And so there's a real responsibility for every\nsingle individual developer that's building any component\nof an app like Telegram to just always ask, you\nknow, \"Can this be done more efficiently? Can this be\ndone more simply?\" And that's like one of the most beautiful\naspects, the art forms of programming, right? - Oh, yes, because when\nyou manage to discover a way to simplify things, make them more\nefficient, you feel incredibly happy. ...and proud and accomplished.\nAnd to your point, I can recall a few instances\nin my career when firing an engineer actually\nresulted in an increase in productivity. Let's say you have 200\nengineers building the app, and then just... they just can't make\nit. They're not keeping up with the pace of the feature\nrelease schedule, and you think, \"I probably have to\nhire a third one.\" But then you notice that one of them is really weird,\nfalling behind the schedule, complaining some of the time, doesn't\nassume responsibility. And you ask, \"So what if I just fire\nthis person?\" And you fire this person. In a few weeks, you realize you actually don't need, I mean, you\nnever needed the third engineer. The problem was this guy who created more\nissues and more problems than he solved. That is so counterintuitive\nbecause, you know, in developing tech projects we tend to think that\nyou just throw more people into something and then things get solved\nmiraculously by themselves just because more people means more\nattention from them. No. - That's, again, extremely powerful. The\nyou know, Steve Jobs talked about A players and B players, and there's\nsomething that happens when you have B players, which is kind of like\nthe folks you're talking about, introduced into a team. They can\nsomehow slow everybody down. They demotivate everybody. And\nit's very counterintuitive. They basically... Part of the\nwork of creating a great team is removing the B players.\nIt's not just hiring more in generally speaking.\nIt's finding the A players, quote unquote, and removing the\npeople that are slowing things down. - Oh, yes, because the other thing\nthat people don't realize is how demotivating working with a B player is. Everybody can tell if the other person,\nthe other engineer they're working with is really competent. And\nit's very visible if the person is not comfortable,\nthey're asking the wrong questions, they keep lagging behind.\nAnd at a certain point if you're an A player, you get this\ndissatisfaction, this feeling that you are not able to realize your full\npotential, accomplish what you're really meant to accomplish\nbecause of this person working next to you or\npretending to work next to you. And, by the way, in some cases\nit's not because the person's lazy. In some cases it's just, you\nknow, their mental, their intellectual ability is not there. It's not about\nexperience. Most often it's about natural ability and persistence. In 90%\nof cases, it's just the inability to focus on one task for an extended period\nof time. Not everybody has this ability. So for people who do have this ability,\nit's an insult to work alongside someone who is distracted and cannot go deep in\nthe projects that they're responsible for. - What's on this small\ntangent, what's your hiring process? You've shown, you've talked about how you use competitions often, coding\ncompetitions, to hire, to find great engineers. What- what's\nyour thinking behind that? - Well, it's in line with\nmy overall philosophy. I think competition leads to\nprogress. If you want to create an ideal process to- for selecting the\nmost qualified people for certain specific tasks you have in mind.\nWhat can be better than a competition? A coding contest where everybody who wants to join your company\nas an engineer, or just wants to get some prize money or validation,\ncan demonstrate their skills, and then we just select\nthe best. Or if we are not certain because there's not enough data to hire somebody, we just repeat\nthe contest with another task, get more data, get more winners. Then repeat again. At some point, you\nrealize, \"Oh, actually, this guy has competed in 10 of our contests since\nhe was 16 years old, or 14 year old. Now he's 20 or 21. He\nwon in eight of these competitions. He seems to be really good\nin JavaScript, in Android Java, and also C++. Why not hire this person? There's some consistency there. And a lot\nof these people, they have never worked in a big company before, which is\npriceless. Because in a big company, people tend to shift responsibility.\nThey have this shared responsibility wherein\nnobody fully understands who can take credit for a project,\nwho can take blame for a project. Inside Telegram, it's pretty\nclear, and these competitions are the closest experience to what people\nwill have when working at Telegram. So for example, we want to\nimplement some very tricky animation and redesign to our\nprofile page of the Telegram Android version. And the Android app, it's\nan open-source app. Anybody can take its code and play with it.\nSo as a result, we would not just select the best\nperson and hire this person, we would also select the best\nsolution to the problem, because we would not suggest the contestants\nto solve trivial problems. It's something that's\nvaluable, it saves a lot of time for us in terms of development.\nAnd because I always had these large social\nmedia platforms which I could use to promote\nthese competitions... ...somehow both VK and Telegram\nwere very popular among engineers and designers, other tech people. I had no issue to promote\nthis contest and find the right people, ever. And\nwhat can be better than for an employee of your company,\nsomebody who has been a user of it? If this person has no prior experience of using Telegram, their\nunderstanding would be very limited. Why would I even try to\nhire somebody from LinkedIn who worked at Google and other companies, is\nused to receiving a salary for nothing, is used to shifting responsibility\nand being stuck in endless meetings, and has very limited understanding\nof what Telegram stands for? It's just crazy if you think about it. - Yeah, and then because of that,\nyou're extremely selective and slow in hiring. So the people really have to earn their spot. And as a\nresult, I got a chance to sit in one of the team meetings where\npeople discuss the different features that are being developed, the\ndifferent ideas, some of which are at the very cutting edge. So you get to see behind\nthe scenes how it's possible to have such a fast rate of idea generation. So you generate the\nidea, you implement the prototype and then eventually it becomes an actual feature in the product. And so that's why\nyou have this kind of half-hilarious, half-incredible fact that for\nmany as compared to WhatsApp and Signal, you've led the way in many other\nfeatures. Many of the features we take for granted now, many of which we know\nand love, like the auto-delete timer. That was seven years ahead of any\nother messenger. Message editing, replies, these are all\nobvious things you... I've even forgotten for some of\nthem that they were never part. I mean, I think the auto-delete\ntimer is a really brilliant idea. - We implemented it in 2013 in the secret chats. The funny thing about it is\nthen when other apps started to copy it, like WhatsApp seven years after,\nand then Signal and some other apps, they initially even copied the exact timestamps. So for example, if we had like\none, three, and five seconds, they would also have one, three, and five seconds. They tried not to change it\nbecause they were not sure what was the magic sauce\nbehind the feature. And ironically, it happens\nwith many of these things. For example, when we design how you reply\nto a message, and you have a small snippet showing that you're replying to this\nmessage and now you're typing your response, then there is a small\nsnippet in the message itself that, well, if you tap on it,\nhighlights the original message you're replying to. Seems\npretty obvious. But there are certain design decisions that we\nwere implementing at the time, and we got this vertical line on\nthe left, and all these other small things that are completely arbitrary,\nright? You can do it in a different way. But somehow, the\nentire industry ended up copying exactly that solution,\nso now wherever you go, WhatsApp, Instagram Direct,\nFacebook Messenger, Signal, it doesn't matter, you would see\nexactly the same or pretty much similar experience because nobody\nreally wants to take the risk and innovate. If something\nworks, why not just copy it? - Yeah, but we should say that it's done\nextremely well. The vertical line and the highlighting, I mean, all of these\nare tiny little strokes of genius by highlighting the text in a\ncertain way that, from a design perspective, makes it very clear that this part was written before\nand the thing under it is your reply. The distinction between the different\nformatting of the text. I mean, there's a... listen, I know how much typography is\nan art form. There's a lot of interacting graphic artistic elements inside Telegram\nthat all have to play together extremely well. Like you pointed out to me,\nthere's this thing that just blew my mind, which is the background gradient\nof Telegram shifts. It changes and it adjusts really nicely to the bubbles,\nthe chat bubbles, and then there's like graphic elements on top of the gradient\nthat all interplay together. So all of that has to work really\nnicely without sacrificing clarity. Everything is just\nintuitive. That's very difficult to create. That is art.\nAnd on top of that, it's super fast. - That's the hardest part. To make\nit look so that designers love it is one thing. The\nreal challenge is make it look the way the designers\nlove it and make it work on the weakest device\nas possible, the oldest, cheapest smartphones\nyou can imagine. So if you take the moving gradient\non the background of every Telegram chat, this\nis something most people don't notice, but they can feel it. - Yeah, yeah. They notice it subconsciously\nor something like that. There is a pleasant feeling. There's a feeling,\nthere's a pleasant feeling when you're\nreading a chat and that's where the design contributes\nto that. I think a gradient really does. I really\nlove that about Telegram, the gradient. Not the technical thing you\ndescribed, but the feeling of it. And then the technical aspect\nof creating that feeling is incredible. I could probably come\nup with all kinds of algorithms of rendering that gradient that's\ngoing to be super inefficient. And so doing that efficiently is like... - Or efficient, but not\ntoo beautiful, because- - Right. - ...even doing something so\ntrivial as a gradient can result in noticeable lines in the gradient. The person can instantly say, \"Oh, no, it's\nnot the right thing.\" So you have to introduce certain randomness there and then you have the gradient, but it's\nnot enough. It's too plain. You want to have certain pattern\nas an overlay, but it should be simple enough not to\ndistract you from the content, but it has to be entertaining enough\nto create a good feeling about the whole app. And another\nquestion, what kind of objects you want to include in this pattern? And\nhow would this pattern work? Will it be based on pixels or would it be\nvector-based? And would it be vector-based so they will be infinitely\nscalable and high quality? And then, I think for the\ndefault pattern and the default background, which is based on four\ncolors. It's not a gradient based on two colors; it's four colors, and they're\nconstantly shifting. I probably looked through several thousand variations of them because this is such an important decision to make.\nIt's the default back. Of course, you can change it. Actually, you can set up your own\nfour colors for that. You can change it. - No way. Really? - Yes. You can do it. And you\nwant to rely on certain deeply hard-coded biological\nproperties of the human mind, right? So\nwhich color do you want to use? Is it gonna be blue?\nIs it gonna be yellow? Is it going to be green?\nBecause each color has a different meaning in our brain.\nAnd what kind of objects you want to put there. Something from our childhood, something from\nnature, or something that can create a different kind of mood.\nAnd this is just one detail of the app. So there are many\ndetails. When you send a message, you are done typing a\nmessage, and you then tap send and then the message gradually appears in\nthe chat. How does it happen? So you want the input field to slowly\nmorph into the actual message. - To the message, yeah. - And, and you want this to\nbe done regardless of the contents of the message, because sometimes\nthe width would be different, sometimes it would be containing media or a link\npreview or other stuff that will change the message bubble. So you go\nthrough countless different scenarios and make sure\nevery one of them works great, even if this message contains\n4,000 characters. And then you look at all the platforms: iOS,\nAndroid, and all the old devices of all kinds of outdated operating systems and the hardware and you cross the\ntwo because you can have this really bad old phone but using\nthe newest operating system version, so what do you do?\nWhat kind of bugs do you get there? And then, of course, since\nTelegram works on tablets as well, and our iOS version\nworks on an iPad, which I love a lot. You\nhave to understand that everything can be really big, so it can\nconsume a lot of space on your screen. and then it will trigger using more\ncomputational resources to render it. So, there are a lot of nuances to it, but as\nlong as you obsess over every small detail, at least every detail that\nreally counts, you can get to a user experience. If you're really\nused to Telegram, if you've been a regular user for at least a few weeks,\ngoing back to any other messaging app feels like a serious downgrade. - Yeah, I mean, there are so many really\nmagical moments. Like, for example, the way a message evaporates when you\ndelete it. That is a really pleasant experience. - Oh, yeah. And boy, was it hard to make, particularly\non Android? This is this Thanos snap effect, right? So,\nthe message is broken into tens of thousands of particles\nwhich go away like dust in the wind. It looks great,\nbut it was so hard to make. - probably one of my favorite GUI\ngraphical things. It's just art. It's it's pure art. It's incredible. So,\nit's good to hear that it's been really thought over and thought through,\nbecause it's extremely well done. - No, you can't pull it off if you're not going deep into this. And then you\ndon't want to distract people from their communication with all this additional information, so you want\nthem to be invisible in a way. - They create the feeling, but\nthey don't create distraction. - Yes, and in order to do that,\nyou have to overcome even more challenges. For example,\nyou mentioned this deletion effect: message evaporates.\nIf you do the animation, if you show the animation first,\nand then the message that is preceding the deleted message\nthat is going after the just deleted message moves closer to each other,\nthen it doesn't feel right. It feels too long, too imposing. So, what you want\nto do is you want the message to disappear while the messages around it go closer\nto each other to fill the resulting gap. And then you imagine what that involves, redrawing the entire screen. So, on top\nof this very complicated animation, you have to think about things\nlike which kind of messages were there before it, after. That\njust adds to complexity. - And once again, on all kinds of devices,\nall kinds of operating systems, all kinds of tablets, phones, desktop, all of that. - But, you know, once you accomplish\nit, it gives you this immense sense of pride because\nnobody's doing this. Nobody really cares. In a way, maybe they're\nright not to care. Maybe nobody notices this. But there is something\nabout it that feels wrong when such things are neglected\nbecause I understand that every day, tens of millions of people around\nthe world are deleting messages. What kind of experience do they get? Is this an experience that maybe\neven subconsciously inspires them and makes their heart\nsing even a little bit, fills them with joy, lightens up their\nmood even a little bit by 0.001%? Or is it something that is just\nbasic? And I think if we can bring some value into\npeople's lives, even through these subtle details, we have to\ndefinitely invest our time in it. - And some joy, not just sort of\nvalue, value like productivity, but joy. I think Steve Jobs, Jony Ive\ntalked about this. They would put so much love and effort\ninto the design of everything, including things that weren't visible\nin the initial PCs, personal computers, because they believe that somehow through osmosis, the users will be\nable to feel the love that the designers put into the thing, and\nyou're absolutely right. I mean, it's not about deleting\nmessages. I feel a little inkling of joy when I see that\nevaporation animation. It's just nice. I'm happier because of it, and\nso I feel that effort, and I think, you know, a\nbillion users feel that. - People like when other people care. - Yeah. Yeah. That's exactly what it is. And of course, there are the\nmore sexy things like all the emojis and the stickers, the GIFs. Many\nof those are just little art pieces. - That's, again, an intersection of art\nand technology because you look at the stickers, which Telegram launched\nway before most of these other apps. - Three years and eight months ahead. - Ahead of WhatsApp, yes. But the stickers that WhatsApp\nended up launching three years and eight months after, the\nfirst version was not really good because they just did regular\nGIFs or WebM videos, which were not based on vector graphics. What we did is vector animations.\nEach of these stickers is only several kilobytes, sometimes maybe\na maximum of 20, 30 kilobytes in size. But it's 180 frames. We were\nable to run them at 60 frames per second on all devices. And it's also very challenging. It was a challenging\nthing to do. We had so much headache trying to make it work. Nobody even\ntried to do anything like this before us because it's crazily difficult.\nBut as a result, you have these fluid animations, you have this really\nnice user experience. Somebody sends you a sticker, you don't have to wait for\nit to load because it's so lightweight and it starts moving instantly.\nAnd then of course, it's not just engineering. You have to find designers\nthat are able to create the stickers using vector graphics, which\nmeans they're based on curves described by\nformulas, not just created as photographs with pixels.\nWhere do you find these people? Again, we did competitions but\nit was not easy to assemble a team of artists, slash engineers, I would\nsay, that are able to do something like engineers I would say that\nare able to do something like this. This is a unique form of\nart. And this allowed us to do a revolution in stickers,\nthen another revolution in animated emoji that you\ncan add into messages, custom animated emoji. I don't think\nanybody did that. I think Telegram is still the only one allowing\nusers to do that because you can include a hundred of\nanimated emoji in a message and they will be animated and they will\nbe moving and your device won't crash. It's probably unnecessary and crazy\nbut we think somewhere in this intersection of art and engineering true quality is created and then\nof course more recently we expanded into what\nwe call Telegram GeMs. which are essentially blockchain\nbased collectibles that you can demonstrate on your\nTelegram profile so that they get social relevance but you can\nalso use them to congratulate your friends and close ones with their\nbirthdays and other holidays and that was received extremely well. - Yeah, they can hold value, they can increase in value,\nyou could trade them for that in that aspect, but to me, still the... The vector graphics,\nand it's not just simple graphics, it's incredibly intricate graphics\nso the vector makes it very efficient but it also allows you to\ncreate, maybe it incentivizes the artist, enables them, incentivizes them to\ncreate super detailed intricate elements and then the final result like you\nwould think it wouldn't matter but the final result has like a lot of stuff going\non and it's, and it allows you to scale on arbitrary devices\nand not, now it's like this little... you know like usually GIFs\nfrom like back in the day and still in meme form are low resolution and so\nusually people don't put details and intricate art into it but here\nwith vector graphics it's like, like a million things going on and\nit allows you to play with different animations like you showed me\nthis thing where you send and you hold for a while on the send button and so you can share with the person\nyou sent a message to this animation that you've encoded. Like there's\na bunch of stuff going on when they read the message. - Yes, we have a lot of features\nlike that when we use this art to allow people\nto express themselves. and most people don't even\nknow about these features. - I didn't know about it. That\nwas cool. That was cool. - The other application of the\nsame technology is reactions on Telegram because we made it\na goal to make sure that people feel joy when they just send\nyou a like. Something so trivial as just adding a like to a message\nshould be an action that you want to perform again and again and again. - So another feature is on the more serious\nside is end-to-end encryption. So you led the industry in that. It was launched one year and three\nmonths ahead. Can you speak to why you decided to add\nend-to-end encryption, how you developed the current encryption algorithm in\nthe beginning? What was your thinking behind that? - So in 2013 when we were\nlaunching Telegram, we were aware of the\nserious issue with privacy that Edward Snowden made very clear. And we thought, yes, we are designing\nthis product in a way that is already extremely secure,\nbut we want to make sure that not even we can\naccess user messages. And we understood very clearly\nthat a bunch of people who were born in Russia don't\nnecessarily inspire trust. So that's why we made Telegram open\nsource. So all our apps have been open available on GitHub since 2013. And then we added end-to-end encryption in\nour secret chats, which WhatsApp copied a few years after. One year and three\nmonths ahead, they just started to test it. They rolled it out\nI think 2016, which is three years after us, and the only\nreason I think the rest of the industry had to do it is because\nwe set the standard. It was incredibly important back in the\nday, and at the same time, we realized certain limitations of end-to-end\nencryption. So within that design, that architecture,\nyou can't support very large chat communities\nwith consistent, persistent chat histories. You can't support huge\none-on-many channels. You'd have issues with maintaining bots that have\nlots of incoming messages. Multiple device support\nbecomes tricky. People will end up losing some of the\ndocuments they share, so we also saw a lot of issues, and\nwe ended up having this sort of hybrid experience, where\ndepending on your use case and your requirements, you can choose the\nlevel of encryption that we want to have. - So that's why you chose to go\nopt-in for end-to-end encryption. So the trade-off there that\nyou're describing is between, for people who really care about\nspecific messages extreme privacy on those messages, and\nusability, like being able to sync across multiple devices,\nhaving groups that are 200,000 people. So all of those features, that quality of life features,\nthere's a trade-off between those and end-to-end\nencryption. So you lean towards letting users sort of enable\nend-to-end encryption for cases when they want to be super secure. - Yes, and Secret Chats are not just end-to-end\nencrypted, you know. There are certain limitations that are both their\nfeature and a bug. For example, you can't screenshot them. You can't\nforward any document, any message from them, which is not necessarily\nsomething you need when you're trying to get some work\ndone and you're just communicating with your team on a project.\nSo it became very clear to us that there are different needs here, and if you try\nto combine both in one type of chat, you will end up losing a lot of utility.\nYou know, we at Telegram, we don't use any collaboration tool for\nteamwork. We use Telegram to build Telegram. So we felt instantly\nwhen we were trying to switch to, say, Secret Chats to share large documents and\ntry to get work done, it was just not adapted for it. At the same time, if you were really paranoid, you think,\nyou know, \"I don't wanna be screenshotted, I don't\nwanna have any leaks, I don't even trust Telegram; I only trust\ncode,\" Secret Chats are the best option. I believe it is the most secure\nmeans of communication today. - And we should say that there's a lot of\nother aspects to this that are important. For example, Telegram is the\nonly app that has open source reproducible builds for both Android\nand iOS. Why is this important? - So, you need reproducible builds\nin order to verify that the app really does what it claims,\nreally encrypts data in a way that it is described on its website.\nFor that, you need to make your apps open source for any researchers\nto have a look at it. So, Telegram has been open\nsource since 2013. Apps like WhatsApp have never been open source, so you\ndon't really know what they're doing and how exactly they encrypt your\nmessages. What's important here, though, is to understand whether the version\nof the app that you download from the app store corresponds exactly to the source code that you can view on\nGitHub. And for that, you need reproducible builds. As you said, Telegram is the only\npopular messaging app that does that. We allow people to make\nsure both on Android and iOS that the source code of Telegram on GitHub and the app you're\nactually using is the same app. I think it's incredibly important, not\njust to gain people's trust, but just to stay transparent and open\nabout it. When I make this claim that Telegram's Secret\nChats are the most secure way of communicating, I\nreally mean it, because I haven't seen any fact contradicting this claim. At least among the popular\nmessaging apps, you say WhatsApp, Signal, iMessage, none of them have\nreproducible builds on both iOS and Android. None of them have, at least at the\nsame level, put so much effort into making sure that\nthe algorithms that you use in order to encrypt data are not\nalgorithms that have been handed to you by some agency in order\nto create a honeypot. At least from what I know\nabout our competitors, I don't think they went\nthrough the same process. - So, we should say that the entirety of the\nsoftware stack in Telegram is done from scratch internally to Telegram, so we're\ntalking about not just the encryption but everything running on the servers. So the servers are built out, the\nhardware and the software are all done internally, which is one of the\nways you reduce the attack surface on the entire stack that\nhandles the messages. - It does make it more secure,\nbecause if Snowden's revelations taught us anything, is that very\noften open source tools, modules, libraries that are used by everybody ended up having certain\nflaws and security issues. that make software\nvulnerable. It's also a way to make sure you're doing things\nthe most efficient way possible. But it's extremely difficult to\ndo that. You really have to have exceptional talent on\nyour team to achieve this level of thoroughness, to go to a low level of coding that allows you to\nrecreate from scratch database engines, web servers, entire programming languages. Because the programming\nlanguage we use on the backend to develop the API for the client apps\nis also entirely built by our team. - Yeah, so minimizing reliance on open\nsource libraries is extremely difficult, as most companies, they rely\non open source libraries. - Well, I wouldn't say we're\ncompletely independent from that. We use Linux on the backend. There's no\nway of avoiding it for us at the moment. But for the most part, we are much more\nself-reliant than most other apps. - You mentioned Edward Snowden. A long time\nago, you wanted to work together with him, perhaps to share expertise to\nunderstand the full realm of this... of what it takes to achieve cybersecurity.\nWhat do you make of his case? What lessons do you learn from\nwhat he has uncovered, and maybe even broadly, what impact has his\nwork had on the world, do you think? - Well, the main lesson is not everything\nis what it seems. As you would discover, and this is something that I found quite shocking\nat the time, that a lot of people who you thought were security\nand cryptography experts ended up being agents of the\nNSA in one way or the other, promoting flawed encryption standards.\nYou would end up discovering that your government that was supposed to be\nlimited in how it can surveil its people actually doesn't consider itself\nthat limited. And that was very valuable for the world to understand. I guess it also can be a\nlesson demonstrating that we humans don't get the balance\nright. So 9/11 created a situation when the government\nhad to respond, and it responded, but it overreacted. It ended up eroding certain basic rights and\nfreedoms, including the right to privacy, because the\ngovernment always wants to increase its powers, and\nthe government always tries to do it at the expense\nof citizens. You have this situation when the cure is worse\nthan the disease. And I think it was incredibly brave to do what Edward\ndid. I didn't get to work with him or ever see him in person. We keep\nin touch, we sometimes communicate, but we're not close. I still\nthink what he did is laudable. I hope someday we'll meet. - You yourself have faced the full force\nof various governments, intelligence agencies. Is there any intelligence agency you're\nafraid of? Any government you're afraid of? - I think they should all be equally\nafraid of, or equally not afraid of in a way. It's not that this intelligence service can kill you\nand the other can't kill you. - They all can kill you? - I guess they all can kill me\none way or the other, but it's a matter of whether\nI'm afraid of death. - This goes back to the beginning of our\nconversation, I think, multiple times. So you're in general fearless\nin the face of the pressure. - That would be a very bold statement,\nbut I proved to be quite stress resilient. And it's not\nthat you don't have fear. You can have fear,\nbut you overcome this fear. I don't think there is anything at this point that can happen\nto change the way I am. - So you went through a\nlot from 2011 to 2014, government pressure that you\nrefused to give in to that led you to create Telegram and let\ngo of VK. And then in 2018, Russia and Iran decided to ban Telegram. That was another\nexample of pressure. Can you take me through that saga in 2018? - So in 2018, Telegram started to become\npopular. I think we had something like 200 million users, and it increasingly became\npopular in places like Iran and Russia, and other countries where sometimes people have something to hide from the government.\nIn Iran, people used Telegram to protest against the government. They\nhad these huge channels that would use to organize the protests, and eventually the government couldn't\nkeep up. They decided to ban Telegram. People would still keep\nusing it, though, using VPNs. It didn't help. The government\ninvested a lot in coming up with their own messaging app. They had several teams competing for the title\nof the national Iranian messaging app. All these\napps failed. People still preferred Telegram. Interestingly,\nIran banned Telegram, but WhatsApp wasn't banned, or at\nleast they unbanned WhatsApp soon after. At the same time, starting\nin mid-2017 or late-2017, Russia demanded that Telegram hand them the encryption keys. They thought\nthese things exist, something that would allow them to\nread messages of every person on Telegram, or at least\nevery person on Telegram in Russia. And we told them, \"That's impossible.\nIf you have to ban us, ban us.\" And this is what they ended\nup doing in spring 2018. And that was quite fun because they were trying to block our IP addresses,\nbut we were prepared for that, and we came up with this\ntechnology that allowed us to rotate IP addresses, replacing them with\nnew ones every time the censor blocks our existing addresses. And then it\nwas completely automated. We had millions of IP addresses. We would be burning\nthrough them. We set up this movement called digital resistance when\nsystem administrators and engineers all around the world, both inside and\noutside Russia, could set up their own proxy servers and their own IP\naddresses for Telegram to rely on in order to bypass censorship. We ended up spending, I think,\nmillions of dollars on that. And as a result, the censor got crazy there.\nThey would ban IP addresses and larger subnets of IP addresses then. Huge\nsubnets which resulted in a weird situation where parts of the\ncountry's infrastructure started to Like people were trying to pay for\ngroceries in the supermarkets, and nothing would work because the Russian censor blocked too\nmany IP addresses. And some of the subnets were used to host other\nunrelated services. Even some Russian social networks and media\ngot affected, banks. So they had to start being more\nselective in how they combat our anti-censorship tools. The biggest\nresistance we got at the time was from Apple. Apple didn't allow us to update\nTelegram in their App Store, saying for at least four weeks that we have to come to an agreement\nwith Russia first. We said, \"It's not possible.\" They said, \"We\nwill allow you to push your update for Telegram worldwide, except for\nRussia.\" We didn't want to do that. Almost lost hope. You know, at some\npoint I said, \"You know, maybe this is the only way. Maybe we should\nleave the Russian market. Stop allowing users from Russia to download\nthe app from the App Store, which would mean it's over.\" We helped organize\ncertain protests in defense of Telegram and privacy and freedom of\nspeech in 2018 in Moscow. There were hilarious people\nflying paper airplanes. - I saw that. - And at some point, I decided, \"I\nhave to make a statement. I have to say that Apple sided with the censor.\"\nThat we are trying to do the right thing here, but without Apple we can't do much, 'cause people can't\ndownload your app anymore. I published it in my channel and then\nthe New York Times picked it up with the picture of the protestors flying paper\nairplanes. Apple was criticized in that story, and I thought, \"Well,\nApple should probably come back to the right side of\nhistory here.\" And I waited for one day and two days. In the meantime, since we've been unable to\nupdate Telegram for more than a month, it started to fall apart because\nthe new version of iOS came out, and it made the old versions of Telegram\nobsolete. Some features that used to work stopped working and users all\nover the world started to suffer. Like, people that had nothing to do with\nRussia from other parts of the world, experienced issues with Telegram. So it was really serious, and I\nsaid to my team, \"You know what? If by 6:00 PM today,\" I\nthink it was a Friday, \"nothing changes and Apple\ndoesn't allow us to push the version of Telegram through,\nlet's just forget about the Russian market. Let's keep going\nbecause the rest of the world is more important.\" It's sad, but what can we do? - Which, by the way, removes all the people\nthat want to protest, all the people that want to talk in Russia, it removes\ntheir ability to have a voice in the most popular messaging\napp in that part of the world. - Yes. Magically, 15 minutes to the time I was planning to remove Telegram from\nthe Russian App Store in order to proceed globally, Apple reached out to us and said, \"It's okay.\nYour update is approved.\" And we managed to keep playing. this hide and seek game with the censor,\nbypassing censorship through digital resistance. In Iran, it was a little\nbit different because we realized it would've been too expensive to try to come up with all those IP\naddresses. And in addition, it was not clear whether we wouldn't be in\nviolation of the sanctions regime, so we did something else. We\ncreated an economic incentive for people who would set up\nproxy servers for Telegram. Any person, say an Iranian engineer, could\ncome up with a proxy server, distribute its address among users in Iran, and\nwhoever connected through the proxy of this person would be able to\nsee a pinned chat, an ad placed there by the system\nadministrator, the owner of the proxy. And this is how you can monetize\nyour proxy, so it created this market, which resulted in Iranians fixing their own problem\nand as a result, we kept millions, or maybe tens\nof millions, of Iranian users. Up until this day, I think\nTelegram is still banned in Iran today, but we probably have something like 50 million people\nrelying on Telegram from that country. - So the people find a way around? - People find a way around. - That's ingenious. That's\nreally great to hear. I have to ask you about this.\nAfter having spent many days with you, I learned of something\nthat you've never talked about at the time, have not\ntalked about to this day, that there was an assassination attempt on\nyou using what appears to be poisoning in 2018. I think to me, it showed the\nseriousness of this fight to uphold the freedom of speech for everyone, for\nall people of Earth that you're doing. I have to say, it would mean a\nlot to me if you tell me this story. - Well, this is something I never talked\nabout publicly because I didn't want people to freak out, particularly\nat the time. It was spring 2018. We were trying to raise funds for TON, a blockchain project, working with\nall kinds of VCs and investors. In the meantime, we had a couple of\ncountries trying to ban Telegram, so it wasn't exactly the best\nmoment for me to start sharing anything related\nto my personal health. But that was something that is hard to forget. I never felt ill. I believe I have perfect\nhealth. I very rarely have headaches or bad cough. I don't take pills\nbecause I don't have to take pills, and that was the only instant\nin my life when I think I was dying. I came back home, opened the door of my townhouse, the place\nI rented. I had this weird neighbor and he left something for\nme there around the door. And one hour after, when I was already\nin my bed, so I was living alone, I felt very bad. I felt pain all\nover my body. I tried to get up and go to the bathroom. But\nwhile I was going there, I felt that functions of my body\nstarted to switch off. First, the eyesight and hearing, then I had\ndifficulty breathing, everything accompanied by very acute pain,\nheart, stomach, all blood vessels. It was... It's a difficult\nthing to explain, but one thing I was certain\nabout is, yeah, this is it. - You thought you were gonna die? - Yeah. This is it, because I couldn't\nbreathe, I couldn't see anything. It was very painful. I think it's over. I thought, well, I have had a good\nlife. I managed to accomplish a few... accomplish a few things. And then I collapsed on the\nfloor, but I don't remember it, because the pain covered\neverything. I found myself on the floor next day.\nIt was already bright. And I couldn't stand up. I was\nsuper weak. I looked at my arms and my body, blood vessels\nwere broken all over my body. Something like this\nnever happened to me. I couldn't walk for two weeks\nafter. I stayed at my place, and I decided not to tell most\nof my team about it, because, you know, I didn't want them to worry.\nBut it was tough. That was tough. - Did that make you afraid of\nthe road you were walking? Meaning all the governments, all\nthe intelligence agencies, all the people. Like we mentioned,\nit's like you're playing a video game. You started with VK\nwhere you're just trying to build a thing that scales and all\nof a sudden you find out there's DDoS attacks attacking the security, the integrity of the infrastructure,\nand then you realize there's politics, and then you\nrealize there's geopolitics, and all of these forces are\ninterested in controlling channels of communication, and you're just a curious\nguy who created a platform for everybody on Earth to talk, and all\nof a sudden you realize there's a lot of people attacking you. How did that change your view? Did that\nmake you more scared of the world? - Interestingly, not at all. If anything,\nI felt even more free after that. It wasn't the first time I\nthought I was going to die. I had an experience when I assumed something bad is going to happen\nto me a few years before that, also in relation to my work. But, you know, after you survive something\nlike this, you feel like you're living on bonus time, so in a way,\nyou died a long time ago, and every new day you get is a gift. - As a bonus. - Yes. - And the first time you're referring to,\nis that... would that have to do with the complexity that was\nhappening with the pressure from the government on VK? And\nthen you had to figure out the increasing pressure and you\nhad to figure out what to do, and you understood that you're losing\ncontrol of VK at that moment? - The first of these instances\nwas in December 2011. In December 2011, you had this huge\nprotest on the streets of Moscow. They didn't trust in the\nintegrity of the election results to the State Duma in Russia. I\nremember in 2011, I still lived in Russia, running VK.\nThere was no Telegram. So the government demanded\nthat we take down the opposition groups of\nNavalny from VK that had hundreds of thousands of members and\nthat were used to organize this protest, and I very publicly refused to do that. I just, you know, decided it's\nnot the right thing to do. People have the right to assemble, and I mocked the prosecutor who handed me\nthat demand and put out a scan of it, and next to it, a photo of a dog\nin a hoodie with its tongue out, and I said, \"This is my official\nresponse to the prosecutor's request to ban opposition groups.\" That was very\nfunny at the moment, but then I had armed policemen trying to get into my apartment, and I thought about many things\nat that moment. I asked myself, \"Did I make the right choice?\" And I came\nto the conclusion that I made the right choice, and I asked myself,\n\"What would be the next thing that would logically follow from this?\"\nAnd I realized, \"They're probably going to put me in prison.\" So what am I\ngoing to do about it? I asked myself. And I told myself,\n\"I'm going to starve myself, starve to death.\"\nIt's something that probably many men have.\nThey're ready to die for other people or certain principles they\nstrongly believe in. I'm not alone here. I guess Edward Snowden was ready to die as\nwell, or some other people like Assange. Also, at that moment, I realized there\nis no way to communicate securely. I need to tell my brother what's going\non. They're probably going after him. How do I tell him without\nbetraying him? Because in 2011, remember, WhatsApp was already\nthere. I think they launched it in 2009, but it had zero encryption.\nAll messages were plaintext in transit, meaning that even your\nsystem administrator, let alone your carrier, had access to your messages. It was only after Telegram started this\npush for encryption that these other apps suddenly remembered that\nprivacy was in their DNA, as WhatsApp founders famously stated,\nbut it must have been a dormant gene. in 2011. So in 2011, there was no way... to send a message in a\nsecure way. And I also told myself, \"If I'm going to\nsurvive this, I'm definitely launching a secure messaging app.\" Somehow it ended up not being too bad. I\nwas summoned to the prosecutor, answered some silly questions, fewer\nquestions that I had to answer more recently in the\nFrench investigation case. But it was the beginning of\nthe end. It was clear that there's no way I'm going to be allowed\nto run VK the way I wanted it to run. That was the moment I packed my backpack and just started to\nwait. I moved to a hotel and realized any day I can\nleave the country. I kept running VK. I started to design Telegram and assembling the team, but I knew\nmy days in Russia were numbered. - Well, first, I really\nhave to say for myself, millions, maybe hundreds of millions,\nmaybe the entirety of Earth, thank you for putting your life on the line in those cases.\nI think freedom of speech is fundamental to the flourishing of humanity,\nso. And it depends on people willing to put everything on the line\nfor their principles. So, thank you. Quick pause. I need a bathroom break.\nAll right. We're back, and once again, we had a super long day,\nand the fact that you would spend many hours with me,\nthank you for powering through. We got this. It's\nalready late at night. - Thanks for doing this. - Okay. So there is increasing indication,\nI think, from things I've seen online that Russia is\nconsidering banning Telegram. First of all, do you think this might happen?\nAnd what effect do you think this might have on humanity? And, in general,\nwhat do you think about this? - It can definitely happen. As you said,\nthere are certain indications. There have been certain test attempts to partially\nban it. Telegram is no longer accessible in parts of Russia, such as\nDagestan. It would be incredibly sad if Russia restores its attempts to ban Telegram, because currently it's being used\nby its population for all kinds of purposes, not just personal communication or economic\nbusiness activities. But also, it's communication or economic business\nactivities. But also, it's the only platform which allows the Russian people\nto access independent sources of information. If you think about media outlets such as BBC or\nany other non-Russian sources of information, they're only accessible in Russia through\nTelegram in the form of Telegram channels. The websites are banned. Some other social\nmedia sites are banned. And as you said, like, there are indications that Russia is planning to migrate users from existing\nmessaging apps such as WhatsApp and Telegram to their own homegrown tool, which would, of course, be fully\ntransparent to the government and wouldn't allow voices independent from\nthe government to express themselves. It's certainly an alarming trend. We see these\nattempts in countries that are not famous for countries that are not famous for protecting freedom of speech, but\nalso increasingly in countries that have been known to protect\nfreedoms. And this creates this vicious circle, because in a way European countries trying\nto fight freedom of speech under pretext that sound\nlegitimate, such as combating misinformation or election\ninterference. They create precedents, and they legitimize restrictions to\nfreedom of speech, which then, in turn, can be used by authoritarian\nregimes. And they would say, in places like China or Iran that they're not doing anything different.\nIt's the norm now to restrict voices that that don't go in line with\nthe mainstream narrative. That's sad, because one\nof the things that makes our life interesting is\nthis abundance of different viewpoints, of different people that\nwe get to experience. You limit the freedom of people, you\ninevitably decelerate economic growth, level of\nhappiness, the way people can contribute to society,\nthe way people can express themselves. I personally think\nit would be a huge mistake to ban a tool like Telegram in any country, particularly a large\ncountry such as Russia, because the Russian people are incredibly talented\nand resilient people. They are among the first to start utilizing some of these\nrecent innovations that Telegram implements. They are the early\nadopters. I'd say them and also the Americans, perhaps other people\nfrom Eastern Europe like Ukrainians and Southeast Asians. They're\namong the first people to start using any new addition that we launch.\nThey're incredibly hungry for innovation. - So all that said there's as part of the propaganda, and in general,\nthere's attacks on you all over the place. There's misinformation. I've\nread a bunch of things that are, I think, in a systematic way,\nlying about you, lying about Telegram from all angles. Why do you get\nattacked so much by everybody? - Well, protecting freedom of speech is\nnot a way to make a lot of friends. Because you would inevitably find\nyourself in a situation where you would be protecting the freedom of the opposition to the current\ngovernment in any country to express themselves. And then\nthe initial reaction and a very basic, instinctive reaction of any government\nwould be to say, \"Oh, our opposition shouldn't be trusted and allowed to\nexpress themselves, because they're actually agents of some foreign rival, a geopolitical force\nthat wants to destroy our country.\" This is something that every\nauthoritarian regime in history used. You take Stalinist Russia or Nazi\nGermany, Maoist China. They'd always use the same trick. They'd say,\n\"We need to limit your freedom of speech, because these people who are\nmasquerading as opposition are actually the agents of this\nother country that wants to take over. That's why, dear\ncitizens, forget about your freedoms.\" And now increasingly,\nyou see similar attempts in free countries. The initial instinct\nfrom, say, President Macron's team when they're confronted with some footage, for example, the footage of his wife\nslapping him, would be to say it's all fake Russian imagery, something that is inaccurate, something that is misinformation\nor interference. And then when they are confronted with more information, they\nhave to refine the narrative. So when you find yourself in a situation\nthat you're running this platform like Telegram, and then you\nprotect the freedom to express ideas that don't go in line with the\nmainstream narrative, you often find yourself in this crossfire when the\nforces in power will say that you must be working with some\nforeign government that they don't like. Inevitably they would say that. \"Oh, if you're protecting\nthese voices, it's not right.\" They love you when you're protecting\nthe freedom of speech in a country that is far from them, or\nbetter yet, in a country that is their geopolitical rival.\nThey praise you for that, but then they have this bipolar attitude when you do the same in their own\ncountry. And they say, \"No, no, no, no, no. We loved you for protecting\nfreedom of speech, but not here. Not in my backyard. We don't\nneed it here. We're all right. We have free press.\" And then you\nwill find yourself in this weird spot and Ukrainians say you work for the Russians,\nthe Russians say you work for the Ukrainians. And all this schizophrenia\nis something that we had to deal with for some time, because it's a\nvery easy way to attack you. At some point you don't understand\nwhere it is coming from. Is it our competitors? And we must give\ncredit to our competitors if it's their invention to launch\nthese kind of rumors, because at a certain point they must have realized\nthey can't compete technologically on the product side, so they\nmust do something like this. Or it's just governments launching these\nrumors, trying to discredit the platform, trying to scare\ntheir citizens away from it, because they understand that their\npower and grip over their own country is in danger, as long as they allow a\npro-freedom platform to operate. - And through all of this, we should\nsay over and over that you are simply preserving the\nfreedom of speech for all people of Earth, no\nmatter what they believe, as long as they don't call for\nviolence and as long as they're not doing some of the criminal activity\nthat we discussed, including terrorist organizing. But other than that, it doesn't\nmatter what their belief, left wing or right wing. You're just preserving their freedom of\nspeech. You think people of Ukraine, people of Russia, and people of Iran, people\nof all over the world understand that, despite the propaganda against you? - I think people are\nsmart. Every time I meet somebody from one of these countries\nyou mentioned, in real life, people recognize me in the street. Say here\nin Dubai, they come over, they seem incredibly grateful and understanding.\nThe propaganda in each of these countries would tell them a number of things,\nbut they learned to discount it. That's why they're so happy that Telegram\nexists, is because the way they can understand the world\naround them is to receive conflicting, mutually exclusive viewpoints\nfrom sources that hate each other, and try to understand what really is true, because there's no such\nthing as an unbiased source of information. When the war\nin Ukraine started in 2022, I instantly realized\nTelegram is going to be used to spread propaganda by both sides, and I didn't want Telegram to\nbe used as a tool for war. I said, and I posted it publicly,\nI suggested maybe we should just suspend the activity of\nall politics- related channels in both countries\nfor the time of the war. Maybe we shouldn't have channels\nin these two countries. And then, interestingly, people from\nboth countries revolted against this. They told me, both people in Ukraine and in\nRussia, that I don't get to babysit them and decide for them what\nsources of information that they have to be granted access\nto. They are grownups that can make these decisions for themselves. They understand that there\nis a lot of propaganda. They learn to see through this propaganda.\nThey learn to be able to tell truth from lie. And in this time of war, it\nwas particularly valuable for them to receive as much information as possible,\nbecause their relatives, their friends were getting affected and are\nstill getting affected. They want to understand what was going on. At that point, I realized people\nare smart, people get it. People can see through it. If you\nask most people in any of these countries, \"Do you agree that access to Telegram should be restricted\nfor whatever reason?\" They would say no. - They hunger to have a voice. - They need a voice and they need a\nplace to share their opinion securely. - I have to ask you, on the\nquestion of leadership in the LaPointe interview, the journalist said\nthat you're often compared to Elon Musk. And you highlighted some interesting\nnuances around that, that you're quite different; that Elon\nruns several companies at once while you only run one, and Elon can lean more on the emotional\nside while you deliberate and think deeply before\nacting. Can you expand on this? Also, there's an interesting\npoint that you made that everybody's weakness is also a strength.\nEverybody's strength is also a weakness. There's a dual nature to\nall our characteristics. So, on the topic of Elon, what have\nyou learned from his style of leadership? What do\nyou respect about him? - First of all, I don't think\nthere is such thing as a negative personal\ntrait. In most cases, our bad traits and our good traits are the\nsame trait or at least have the same source. Of course, there are\nsome extreme examples, but I'd say 99% of people, if you analyze\ntheir character, their bravery can be seen in recklessness in other situations.\nDepending on circumstances, you would see exactly the same personality\ntrait, and it would be either a good thing or a bad thing,\nbecause humanity is perfect as a whole and each of us is different\nfor a reason. We have evolved to be different, to complement each other's\nabilities so that together we are invincible. And even if you take a person as complicated as Elon, I believe\nthat certain traits that Elon demonstrates, that people\ncriticize about him, are also the sources of his strength.\nFor example, his emotionality is derived from the fact that\nhe cares about issues deeply and he is willing to start as many\nwars and as many fights as it takes to change the world in the\ndirection that he thinks is right. He also seems to be able\nto extract motivation from all these wars and personal conflicts,\nwhich is, again, not something to be underestimated. At a certain\npoint in the life of a successful entrepreneur, the question of motivation starts to be the primary\nquestion. If we're talking about the most richest person in the world and\nthe most famous entrepreneur in the world, you have to wonder, how does\nhe motivate himself? And if starting a war on X, debating certain issues, or becoming personal with other CEOs,\ncriticizing them, if these activities help Elon to innovate and start new projects, he should be doing\nmore of it. There's nothing wrong in being non-agreeable. Actually, it's\none of the main traits of a successful entrepreneur, not agreeing with things. And every time somebody like Elon... But\nthere is no somebody like Elon. There's just Elon. I think, at least\nfrom the entrepreneurs I know and I personally interacted with,\nhe's unique in the sense that he keeps launching new things,\nrunning them in parallel, and he doesn't seem to be stretched too\nthin. Well, some people think he is, but he manages to still demonstrate success\nin all or most of his endeavors. So again, you can criticize Elon for\nbeing emotional, but would he be the same person without this? I doubt that. - and the incredible teams he's motivated\ntoo. There's an element of that, which you've spoken about. The\nteam at Telegram, you know, assembling a team of A-players, as we've talked about, is a skill\nin itself. And that's also a big part of the the leaders that\nwe've discussed, is like what, judged in part by the team you assemble. - Yes. And one of the necessary\ncharacter features to enable that is to be ready to be unpleasant. You have\nto be ready to insult some people if their work is inferior.\nYou have to be ready to fire them without remorse. So in order to be an efficient and great entrepreneur\nand enrich the world of innovations, you have to do unpleasant things. Most\npeople will shy away from it. And in a certain sense, entrepreneurs\nsacrifice their peace of mind in order to contribute to the world around them.\nAnd Elon is a great example of that. - I have to ask you about the\nbig picture of Telegram. We've already talked about the\nfact that you own 100% of it, and there's a lot on the business side of\nit. The business structure of Telegram is fascinating. You've invested 100, maybe\nhundreds of millions of dollars of your own money. As far as I know, you\ntake a salary of what? $1? - One dirham is one-third of that. - One-third of a dollar. And\nin 2024 was the first time Telegram was profitable. So one\nof the interesting questions is, here, that we could talk for many hours\nabout, but I'd love to get a high-level view picture. You've left what I understand, what I think is a\nhuge amount of money on the table by sticking to your principles. For\nexample, not doing advertisement that's based on user private\ndata, which basically every social media company does. So,\nthe only advertisement that Telegram does is based on channels\nand groups, based on the topic, not the private data of the\nindividuals. And the other thing is, which is also gangster\nand incredible, is you don't do a news feed, which\nis the most addictive and engagement-inducing aspect of social media,\nwhich feeds the very kind of addictive downside of the internet: the distraction,\nthe engagement drama, farming aspect that we've talked about in the\nvery beginning that you try to resist, that you think is damaging the human\nmind at scale. So anyway, that's just speaking to the fact that you're\nleaving a lot of money on the table. So, how the hell were you able to be\nprofitable? What are the ways that Telegram makes money? - Yeah. We had to innovate a lot in order\nto reach a point where we are profitable without having to resort to dubious\nbusiness activities involving exploiting personal data of users,\nsomething that most of our competitors do. Because money has never been the primary\ngoal, at least not for me. When I sold the remaining share of my first company,\nI had to do it below market price because I didn't leave Russia completely\nwithout any pressures, you know? I reinvested the vast majority\nof everything in Telegram. Telegram is an operation that is\nlosing money for me personally. I never... I didn't extract more from\nTelegram than I invested in it. I never sold a single share. But I also didn't want to sell Telegram,\nso how do you reach a point when you're profitable without\nsacrificing your values? One of the ideas we\nexplored was a subscription model, but only for certain additional features. We wanted to keep all the\nexisting features free, and just add more business-related tools\nor tools for advanced users that they would have to pay for,\nsay, four or five dollars a month. It was quite unprecedented at\nthe time. It wasn't considered a viable option for messaging\napps to do that. We launched the premium subscriptions\nfor Telegram in 2022, and now we have over 15 million\npaid subscribers. This is some very significant recurring\nrevenue. So, we would receive more than half a billion\ndollars from premium subscriptions alone this year, and it's growing fast. For that, we had to innovate a lot. We\nincluded over 50 different features into the premium package.\nAnd then, how do you make an app that is already\nmore powerful than any other messaging app on the market even more useful so that people\nwould be ready to pay for this extra? That wasn't easy.\nThat took a lot of effort. - And you're constantly adding features. - We're constantly adding features. - That's actually fun to watch, just the\nrate of adding... And some of them are subtle, like the updates to improvements,\nexpansions of polls, for example. - Yes. You keep improving the\nexisting features and adding new ones, and every time when you add a new\nfeature, you don't want to clutter the app. So, in a way, they're not in your\nway. They're invisible. That's not an easy thing to do. And most of the\nfeatures maybe are not even known to the majority of our users. But\nwhen you need them, they're there. So, premium is one source of\nour revenue. We also have ads, but they're context-based, not\ntargeted. Of course, we leave probably 80% of value on the table because we are\nnot ready to engage in all those practices, exporting personal data. - Just to be clear,\ntargeted ads is what most social media companies, most tech companies\nthat do any kind of advertisement do, and that's the kind of advertisement\nthat uses personal data from users, just to clarify. And when you\nsaid 80%, that's a lot of money. - Of course, because we would never\nuse, for example, your personal messaging data, or your\ncontacts data, or your metadata, or your activity\ndata to target ads. It's sad that it became\nsynonymous with the internet industry, this kind of\nexploitation, but we are happy with the fact that we managed to\nmake Telegram profitable despite that. We're also experimenting a lot with blockchain-based\ntechnologies. We're the first app to allow people to directly\nown their username and their digital identities using smart contracts and NFTs, removing\nTelegram from the picture. So, for example, Telegram\ncannot confiscate your username from you. It's impossible.\nWe do a lot of things related to the ecosystem of Telegram.\nWe have a thriving mini app platform, millions of mini app developers\nlaunching their own bots and applications. - So, a lot of people are making millions\nof dollars on the Telegram platform? - Yes, we enable them to receive payments from the users through in-app\npurchase mechanisms provided by Apple and Google, which I think was the\nfirst attempt of this kind to allow that both on iOS and\nAndroid, and on a big platform, so that third-party developers of\nmini apps, which are basically websites so deeply\nintegrated into Telegram that you can't tell whether\nthey're standalone or they're part of the overall\nexperience. And by providing this payment option, we are able to extract a\ncommission from these transactions. But it's a very low commission. Presently,\nit's 5%. So we aren't greedy here. We want people to succeed in building these tools for our users. We\nunderstand that mini apps bring us users. The more users we have, the\nmore successful and relevant Telegram becomes. We need\nthird-party developers. I think, at this point, Telegram gives\ndevelopers, by far, the most powerful tools to create. - Plus, there's a bot API, and you\nhave to tell me about the TON blockchain and the crypto\necosystem available through Telegram. So what is TON, also known\nas, the Open Network Blockchain? - TON is a blockchain technology that we\ninitially developed in 2018 and 2019, and we started to develop it because\nwe needed a blockchain platform to be integrated deeply into\nTelegram because we believe in blockchain. We think it's one\nof the technologies that enable freedom. But, at the time, if you look at\nBitcoin, if you look at Ethereum, they were not scalable enough to\ncope with the load that our hundreds of millions of users would\ncreate. They would just become congested. And I asked my brother, \"Can we\ncreate a blockchain platform that would be inherently scalable so that\nno matter how many users or transactions there are, it would split\ninto smaller pieces, which we call shard chains, and\nwould still process all transactions?\" And he thought\nfor a few days and said, \"Yes, it's possible, but it's not\neasy.\" When we started building it, we ended up succeeding in developing that\ntechnology, but we couldn't release it because the SEC, the Securities\nand Exchange Commission in the United States was unhappy with the way the fundraise for TON was\nconducted. So we had to abandon the project, and the open-source community\ntook over. Luckily, because we constantly conducted those\ncontests with third-party developers, there was a\nthriving community around TON, which now stood for The\nOpen Network as opposed to its prior name, Telegram Open\nNetwork. And so this project got eventually launched without\nour direct involvement, and it's thriving now because everything we\ndo, like I said, is blockchain-based, tokenized, usernames, Telegram accounts are all based on TON and\nits smart contracts. It's the only way for third-party\ndevelopers and creators to withdraw the funds that they earn through our revenue-sharing\nprograms. For example, with channel owners, we do a\n50/50 split of ad revenues. It's also the only way to\ntransact on Telegram. For example, if you want to buy ads\non Telegram, you should use TON. All the new things we launch, for\nexample, gifts that we mentioned earlier, which you can define as a\nreinvented socially relevant NFT integrated into a billion-user ecosystem,\nbut at the same time, available on-chain, transferable, which you can own\ndirectly, also based on TON. Incredibly fast-growing space. We only launched them\nabout half a year ago. And now as a result of these Telegram gifts, TON has become, I\nthink, the largest or the second-largest blockchain in terms of\ndaily NFT trading volumes. - So, like you mentioned, it is a\nLayer 1 technology as opposed to being built on top of Ethereum\nor Bitcoin. And it's able to achieve the scale and the\nspeed of transactions that's needed for something like\nTelegram. And like you also mentioned, the gifts.\nYou recently launched some Snoop Dogg gifts. Are there going to\nbe some other celebrities in the pipeline? - Yeah, I'm a big fan of Snoop, and\nthat's why when they reached out, suggesting to do something together,\nI said, \"Let's launch some Snoop-related gifts.\" And it was\nreally fun. We managed to sell 12 million worth of\ngifts within 30 minutes. - 30 minutes. Well, there you go.\nI even got a few, but yeah. - After this, we have many requests from\nmany really high-profile influencers that, in a way, are lining up. - So, from my perspective as a fan, it's just\ninteresting to see what kind of art you create for any kind of celebrities,\nathletes, musicians, because the the Snoop, the Snoop gifts are all just, like, going back to our previous\nconversation, just beautiful pieces of art that, like, encapsulate certain memes,\ncertain aspects of Snoop that everybody knows. These cultural icons\nthat he represents. That's cool. That's just... and they're,\nthe detail, the incredible detail of the art of the individual\ngifts is just incredible. - And each of these gifts is scalable\nbecause it's vector-based. It references certain points in Snoop's creative\nbiography. And each of them has countless different versions. We had to create\nover 50 distinctive versions of each. And then each individual piece is\nunique because it also has unique background, unique icon\nin the background. It's something that we reinvented because we didn't like the old school\nNFTs. First of all, they were not relevant socially because, okay, you\nhave an NFT. Where do you demonstrate it? In a Telegram, a Telegram gift is there next to your name. It's\npart of your digital identity on Telegram. And then you can create\ncollections of gifts and show it off on your profile page. But it also... The other\nthing that we wanted to reinvent is the aesthetic part of it.\nMost NFTs are just ugly and they're not based on any sophisticated\ntechnology. So, what we did with Snoop's gifts, I think\nrepresents an example of beautiful, aesthetically pleasing, and\nat the same time very accurate in terms of references to this\nspecific artist's biography, a mixture between art and\ntechnology, which I think is quite rare. I'm quite proud of it. I\nthink it's a new trend, a new phenomenon. It's only half a year old. So, let's see where it goes. We're\ngonna select our next influencer or artist to be part of it. - Hey, listen, I'm really proud I\ngot a Snoop gift next to my name and I figured out that you can add\neven more by pinning them. It's like a cool little art icon. - We didn't expect it, by the\nway. We just had a lot of fun launching these things\nand then we realized that one of the first collections we issued,\nwe sold each piece at something like $5. And then the minimum price of any\nitems in these collections currently is something like $10,000.\nAnd it keeps going up. So, I was quite surprised with the\nreception. I realized, you know, when you are trying to monetize a\nsocial media platform in a way that is consistent with your values, you're\nforced to find ways that benefit your users, not exploit them. People love these\ngifts. People love the fact that they can congratulate a person close to\nthem with something valuable and at the same time something\nbeautiful. Also, some people make a business out of it, which\nis funny. They resell these gifts. We recently met a guy who\nearned several million dollars just from buying and selling gifts. - It's a real market. - It's a real market. And it's just\nsomething that he did in a few months. And last year when we launched many new features for the\nmini apps on Telegram and, payments options for them\nand the other monetization options, the same guy earned $12 million from mini apps. And I\nknow several people who anecdotally, like, \"I earned\n$10 million, I earned $3 million,\" just in a matter\nof months single-handedly. Sometimes they would have\na team of two, three people. So, whenever I hear\nstories from people who were able to build businesses on top of\nTelegram, this makes me incredibly proud. - And mini apps include games,\nthey include tools, services of any kind. It's an app within\nthe ecosystem of Telegram. Let me ask you about crypto in general.\nSo, you've been an early supporter of, cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin. You\nbought into Bitcoin early on. You kept buying. Maybe you could speak to the reasoning why you\nkept buying Bitcoin. Do you think Bitcoin will go to a million\ndollars? Do you think it'll keep increasing? And Bitcoin and all the\nother cryptocurrencies. - I was a big believer in\nBitcoins since more or less the start of it. I got to buy my\nfirst few thousand of Bitcoin in 2013, and I didn't care much. I think I bought it at the local\nmaximum. It's something like $700 per Bitcoin, and I just threw a couple millions there. And a lot of people\nafter Bitcoin, later next year, went down, somewhere close to\n300, 200, started to express their sympathy to me. They say,\n\"Oh, you're a poor fellow. You made this horrible mistake investing in this\nnew thing, but don't feel bad about it. We still have some\nrespect for you.\" And I, my response to them was, \"I don't\ncare. I'm not going to sell it.\" I believe in this thing. I\nthink this is the way money should work. Nobody can confiscate your\nBitcoin from you. Nobody can censor you for political reasons. This\nis the ultimate means of exchange, and again, I'm now talking\nabout Bitcoin but it relates to cryptocurrencies in general.\nSo I have been able to fund my lifestyle, so to say, from my Bitcoin\ninvestment. Some people think if I'm able to rent nice locations or fly private, it's because I\nsomehow extract money from Telegram. But like I said, Telegram is a\nmoney-losing operation for me personally. Bitcoin is something that allowed me to stay afloat, and I believe it will come\nto a point when Bitcoin is worth $1 million. Just look at the trends. The governments keep printing\nmoney like no tomorrow. Nobody's printing Bitcoin. There is a predictable inflation and then\nit stops at a certain point. Bitcoin is here to stay. All the\nfiat currencies, remains to be seen. - Let me ask you a deeply philosophical, serious\nquestion. In your first Tucker interview you had two interesting chairs\nin the background. I think they reference a now legendary meme the\nchoice is Пики точеные или хуи дрочёные. What is the philosophical wisdom\nin the dilemma that these two chairs present? Have you had to face\nthe dilemma yourself personally? - Not this exact dilemma. I think this is a\nriddle that people have to face in Russian prisons. And metaphorically, it's describing all the situations\nwhere you're presented a choice between two suboptimal\noptions. When you're running a big business or when you're\nrunning a large country, it is similar. You sometimes face this\ndilemma. What are you going to do? This very horrible thing\nor this also very horrible thing? So I think the right\nanswer to this riddle is not to do any of these\nthings. Reframe the question. Design a solution that turns a disadvantage\ninto an advantage, and then use it to cope with the other\nside of the problem. So, do you know the answer to that riddle? - No, somebody on the internet said: \"Не ходи\nтуда, где задают такие вопросы.\" Which is basically, \"Try to avoid\nthe situations where such dilemmas present themselves,\nwhere there's no right answer.\" - This is one of the ways\nto answer this question. If you got to a tricky situation, that\nprobably earlier you made a certain mistake. - You fucked up already. - It should have been avoided. But the\nother quite creative answer to this question is that you is you take the sharp objects from\none of the chairs, or the spikes, and then you use them to cut off the objects from the other chair, and\nyou know what objects I'm talking about. - That's a very engineering solution.\nI'm glad somebody came up with that. - I believe this is the right answer.\nWe're often being manipulated by politicians, by corporate leaders, to\nmake a choice from two suboptimal options, and then when we are forced to make the\nchoice, and we make the choice, it's almost as if it's something that\nwe have to assume responsibility for. I don't think we\nshould be buying into that. - Okay, on this theme of absurdity\nand ridiculousness, let me... there's an object here that appeared\nin the... Not many people seem to have noticed this. People should go watch\nyour excellent conversation in the Oslo Freedom Forum behind you. I'm\nno archeologist, but I believe this is a... well, how should I put it? A walrus penis bone, and it was\nbehind you. You told me that you, that you brought it with\nyou to France and back to Dubai. I assume it brings you luck of some\nsort. What's the... why did you bring it with you everywhere? Is it kind of\nlike, you know, in America they have a wishbone? Is it just a large wishbone? Because a wishbone brings you luck.\nAnd I should also point out that just like with Telegram, with\nthe art, there's tiny little walruses. And thanks to you, I had\nto also find out that a lot of mammals have a bone inside their\npenis, and the evolutionary advantage, I guess, of having a bone\nis quite obvious. It actually raises the question of why humans don't\nhave an actual bone inside their penis. A lot of questions there. - That's a very interesting subject. The reason\nI have this is because a tribe that is almost gone, extinct in\nSiberia and Mongolia, called Evenki, passed me this gift from them. Normally, they would craft\nsomething like this only for their most respected leaders. It is supposed\nto be a token of their appreciation for bravery, courage, leadership.\nIronically, it also translates in a very specific way into the Russian\nlanguage. In Russian, \"walrus's penis\" means something a bit funny, which is often\nused to describe nothing. So, for example, if you've been requested\nby, say, a certain government or a certain business partner to provide something that you are not\nwilling to provide, you can just politely have this penis bone in the background\nwhile you're doing the video call and hope that they would- - through osmosis, figure out the deep\nmessage. It is an indirect rebellion. By the way, in the former\nSoviet Union, there was, and a lot of places throughout history, some of\nthe rebellion had to take this kind of symbolic, metaphoric form, through\npoetry, through children's stories. It's the beauty of human language and art that\nwe're able to do that. Say \"eff\" you to whatever forces that try\nto overpower us. We say \"eff\" you through poetry, through art,\nand sometimes through a rather large walrus penis bone...\ncarried by what appears to be either a happy sumo wrestler\nor a cat of some sort. - They asked a lot of questions\nabout this walrus's penis bone in the airport, both here in the UAE\nand in France. They are always very interested in this thing. - Hmm. There seems to be some confusion\nover how many kids you have. It's often said to be over 100. Can\nyou explain how many kids you have? - The truthful answer to this\nquestion is I don't really know how many biological kids I have exactly, because at a certain point in my\nlife, about 15 years ago, I decided that it was a good idea to be a sperm donor. Initially, a friend of\nmine asked me to help, because they were trying to\nhave a baby with his wife, and they experienced certain health issues\nthat prevented them to do it the natural way. And he asked me,\nhe told me, \"We don't want to just rely on some random, anonymous\ngenetic material. We want somebody we know and respect to be the biological\nfather of our kid.\" And I said, \"You gotta be kidding me. Sounds\nridiculous. What are you even talking about?\" But then\nI realized it's, it's actually a serious issue, and they were\nnot the only couple struggling with that. So eventually, I got\npersuaded into doing more of it. I can't say I'm incredibly\nproud of that, but I think it was the right thing to do, particularly at the time\nwhen I thought, \"Okay, I probably don't have much time on this planet left. Things are getting trickier and\ntrickier, so if I can help some couples have babies, let's do it.\" And then more\nrecently, when I was working on my will, I realized that I shouldn't make\na distinction between the kids conceived naturally and the kids who are\njust my biological kids that I never seen. As long as they can establish their shared DNA with me, someday,\nmaybe in 30 years from now, they have to be entitled to a share of my estate after I'm gone. And that\nmade a lot of noise in the news for some reason. People get very\nexcited by this kind of news. I got a lot of messages from\npeople claiming they're my kids. I got a lot of requests from\npeople asking me to adopt them. The memes were priceless,\nbut understanding that... no, it's not a\nthing that most people do. I don't see anything wrong with it. If\nanything, I think more people should be donating sperm. - So, yeah, we should say that\nthe 100-plus kids is from that, and you also have naturally conceived\nkids. And it was a pretty bold decision to, from a financial perspective,\nto treat them all equally. And also quite interesting was that you kind\nof said that they don't receive any money for the first few decades of their\nlife. Can you describe that thinking? - Yeah, I think overabundance\nparalyzes motivation and willpower. It's extremely harmful, particularly for young boys,\nto grow up in an environment where they can be proud, not of\ntheir own achievements, but of their father's achievements or their father's\nwealth. This removes the incentive to work on developing their own skills,\nremoves the incentive to study, to work. So, I thought if\nthey're going to have this money, it should be something\nthat they would only get when they're already adult. It's\nstill risky. But one of the reasons I decided it makes more sense to\ndivide this huge wealth that I'm likely to leave behind among 100 or more than 100 people,\nis that it won't be too much for every single\ndescendant. But at the same time, some people did the\ncalculation. It's still many, many millions of dollars for each\nchild, so I'm not sure it helps too much. - On the topic of abundance,\noffline, we had a lot of fascinating philosophical discussions,\none of which was about the mouse paradise experiment, also known as\nUniverse 25. It's an experiment from the 1960s and early 70s, conducted\nby ethologist John B. Calhoun. And we can talk about this\none for hours also, I'm sure. But it was an experiment with a few\nhundreds of individual mice compartments, and they provided them with\nunlimited food, water, nesting, no predators, stable temperatures,\nand frequent cleaning. Basically, the definition\nof abundance as far as mice go. And the interesting\naspect of this experiment is that at first the population\ndoubled, it grew very quickly, but then it leveled off, and certain\nreally negative social things started happening. Like mothers neglected or\nkilled their young. Violent attacks and hypersexual activity became widespread. Some \"beautiful\" ones, largely\ninactive, well-groomed mice withdrew, refusing to mate or\ninteract. So, all of these kind of societal qualities that we see as\nnegative for the functioning of a society started to emerge because\nof the abundance, and finally the collapse. The reproduction\nrates crashed. Social dysfunction spread to the next\ngeneration and eventually just went extinct. It didn't just\nplummet to a low level, it plummeted steadily to zero\ndespite the fact that there was ongoing resource abundance. As the description states, \"The last mice\ndied surrounded by untouched food and water.\" So, I mean, there's\ndeep wisdom to that about abundance. It seems...\nYou've mentioned this in different contexts throughout this\nconversation, is it seems like scarcity, it seems like\nconstraints, it seems like non-abundance is essential for human flourishing,\nwhich is a counterintuitive notion. It's true for mice, and I think\nit's probably true for humans too. - We have evolved to overcome\nscarcity. Almost by definition there has never been such thing\nas infinite amount of food or entertainment in our lives before now.\nWe seem as a species to lose our ability to identify purpose in a world where you\nhave everything, and everything loses its meaning. Restrictions are important.\nI think, though, that they should be coming from within. It should be\nself-restriction rather than restriction in order to create purpose and meaning\nin life. In a way, I was lucky in a very counterintuitive way because I grew up poor. I didn't have money when I was a\nteenager. I had the same jacket for years, which was bought on a second-hand\nmarketplace. My father wouldn't receive his salary as a university\nprofessor for months because the Russian state was almost\nbankrupt back then. My mom had to juggle two jobs to take care of us. It was not easy, but it also created purpose,\nit created meaning, it created priorities. It allowed us to focus\non things that mattered, allowed us to develop our character and intellectual\nabilities. Now, if we had everything... why do anything? These mice... suffered societal collapse that\nwas irreversible. And this is not an accident. This kind of experiment\nhas been repeated countless times. At a certain point, social dysfunction and\nthe erosion of social roles becomes contagious, and the society\ngradually degrades into a chaotic collection of individuals unable to take care of the next generation\nor even to produce the next generation, and it goes extinct. - It's fascinating because we're creating\ntechnologies, and this is what AI is proposing to our future generations\nas a problem to solve, which is AI may very well\ncreate abundance. And so we will be like these mice\npotentially, whether it's AI or other kinds of technologies\nthat increase and give more and more to all of us, and it is a thing\nthat will decrease the amount of suffering in the world, increase the quality\nof life. But as we reach towards that abundance, the fabric that connects us, rooted in our biology that's\ndeveloped by evolution might create a real challenge for us. - We should find the right balance\nbetween chaos and order, between self-restriction\nand freedom for creativity. - Your father recently celebrated\nhis 80th birthday. You had a conversation with him.\nHe gave you some life advice. I think you mentioned to me one\nof the things he said was not to just speak of your principles,\nbut to live them, to lead by example. I think this is\nsomething you already do well. Maybe can you speak to what you've\nlearned about life from your father, maybe some of the lessons he told you\nin the conversation you had with him on his birthday? - I'm incredibly lucky to have my father. He's a person who wrote countless books\non ancient Rome and ancient Roman literature, dozens of scientific papers, and I always\nremember him working. He would be busy typing his books and\narticles on an old-school typewriter back in the\nlate '80s, early '90s. He was relentless. The example he\nset to myself and my brother was priceless. Some people make\nthis mistake of thinking that you can instill the right principles in the future generation or into\nyour kids by saying things to them, but kids are smart. They discount\nwords; they look at the actions. So observing our father was\na big lesson by itself. It wasn't necessary for\nhim to say anything to us. And then at the same time, he was\nincredibly patient, emotionally resilient. And, you know, my mom,\ngreat woman, incredibly smart, highly educated, but she would sometimes try to\ntest the patience of my father, and it's a trait rooted in our biology. There's an evolutionary explanation for that, that\nwomen sometimes tend to do that. And he demonstrated incredible patience all the\ntime. He told me recently, \"You shouldn't give the wrong example to the people around you, and in\nparticular, to your kids, because you can do the right\nthing nine times out of ten, but you make a mistake\nonce, and they will instantly copy it. If you're\ntelling your kids not to use a smartphone, but you're using a\nsmartphone all the time yourself and coming up with all kinds of\nsophisticated, brilliant explanations why they shouldn't be using a smartphone,\nit won't land. It's bound to fail.\" So you lead by example. And\nthere are other numerous lessons: staying positive,\nlooking at the bright side, never despair, be honest. And, you know, he\ntold me last time I spoke to him that AI can have consciousness, can be\ncreative, but it cannot have conscience. In a way, it cannot\nbe moral. It cannot have deeply rooted principles,\ncannot have integrity in the meaning that we\nunderstand it as human beings. - I love the fact that you're talking\nto your 80-year-old father and you're talking about AGI. And the\ndifference between human, the human spirit, human nature and\nwhat AGI, AI is able to achieve, and conscience is the thing that humans have. The ability to\nknow the right from wrong. - This is the lesson that he gave me. One of my goals in life is\nnever to disappoint him. - Another thing we've talked\nabout, which I think is a fascinating topic, is the power\nof the mind, power of thought. Do you believe you can\naffect your life in reality by thinking about it, by manifesting\nit into being? What do you think? - There are many explanations\nwhy it works. One thing most people agree on is that setting\ngoals and staying positive and confident does allow you to achieve the\nthings you want to achieve. It's very hard to believe,\nthough, that you can just manifest things into being\nwithout applying effort in the direction that seems to be\nlogical. Maybe some people exist that can just sit on the bank of a river and materialize things by the power of\ntheir thought, but I'm not sure I'm one of these people. I always found it more\neasy to believe that if you couple this optimism and faith with logical action,\nthen it is bound to be successful. - Prolonged effort, hard work coupled with\npositive focus, thinking about the thing. - Oh, yes, over many, many,\nmany days. It is possible to imagine our world as a\nhigh dimensional universe where humans have the ability to\nnavigate through it with the power of belief, which is coupled with positive emotion and logical\nthinking. But we are getting into an esoteric realm. We don't\nhave any proof of that, but we also know that we probably, at\nthis point, haven't discovered even 1% about this universe. - I agree with you fully, and I\nlike what you said in the way you were thinking about it. You've told me before that maybe there's a\nway that with effort and with a focused mind, you can\nshape, you can morph the sort of landscape of probabilities around you, and it's a nice way to visualize\nit, that somehow our effort and our focus changes the things\nthat are likely and less likely, and by focusing on it, we make the thing\nmore and more likely. At least as an estimate, as a kind of field that we through\nour thoughts and through our actions change that field, and there's\neight billion of us doing so. And together there's this collective intelligence\nthat creates the world we see around us, like the mice. And like you\nsaid, us as a humanity together are perfect. I like that you said that. - I admire your belief in the\nfact that we get to experience this together, because it's not obvious. Maybe each of us experiences\nhis own or her own universe, and maybe every second the universe\nsplits into a billion of different universes, and everything that can happen,\nhappens. And there is a universe where, say I died in 2013, maybe every time I\ndie I actually get to shift to a parallel universe where I don't die and then\nit keeps going and at certain points we achieve this quantum immortality\nwhen we are 1,000 years old, but a lot of people from other versions\nof reality think we are long gone. - Yeah, this is something that you explained to me,\nthe idea of quantum immortality, which is a thought experiment, which I find deeply\nfascinating. People should look into it. it. Which is very crisp, clean consequence of the many worlds\ninterpretation of quantum mechanics, that we as conscious beings can't\nexperience our death. We can only... As we branch into these\nmany worlds, only the living consciousnesses get to\nexperience it. So in some sense, yeah, there's many universes. If we're to seriously take the many worlds interpretation of\nquantum mechanics, there's many universes where you died many times, especially you. And I'm glad we're\nin a universe where we get to share the table we're the, in a universe where\nwe get to share the table with this impressive bond,\na little humor and a lot of serious topics covered today. Once again,\nI can't say enough, a giant thank you from me and a giant thank you from hundreds\nof millions of people that follow your work for you fighting for the freedom\nof all of us to speak and creating a platform where we can do so. And\nthank you so much for talking today, brother. It's been an honor\ngetting to know you and to be able to call you a friend. - Thank you for saying that.\nI'm also incredibly grateful to you and to the fact that I happen\nto be in this version of reality. When I haven't died, at\nleast yet. And hopefully we'll get to spend more fun moments\nin the years to come together. - Thank you, brother. Thank you for listening\nto this conversation with Pavel Durov. To support this podcast, please check out our\nsponsors in the description. And now, let me try to articulate some things\nI've been thinking about. If you would like to submit\nquestions or topics like this for me to talk about in the future, go to lexfridman.com/ama. I'd like to use this opportunity\nto talk about Franz Kafka, one of my favorite writers. The reason he has been on my mind is that his work, \"The Trial,\" and the case of Pavel Duro in France has, let's say, eerie parallels, both metaphorically and literally. Of course, \"The Trial\"\nis a work of fiction, but I think it is often useful to go to the surreal world of literature, even of the over-the-top dystopian variety like \"1984,\" \"Animal Farm,\" \"Brave New World,\" \"The Trial,\" \"The Castle,\" \"Metamorphosis,\" even \"The Plague\" by Albert Camus, all to better understand our real world and the destructive paths we have the potential to go down together, which also hopefully helps us understand how to avoid doing so. So lemme zoom out and\nspeak about Franz Kafka. Who was he? He was an insurance\nclerk who wrote at night. He died young and almost\ncompletely unknown, and he asked for his\nmanuscripts to be burned. Luckily for us, his friend, Max Brod, refused to do so, giving us the work of what I consider to be one of 20th\ncentury's greatest writers. In his work, Kafka wrote about the cold, machine-like reduction of humanistic case files through the labyrinth\nof institutional power. He wrote about an\nindividual's feeling of guilt even when a crime has not been committed. Or more generally, he wrote about the feeling of anxiety that is part of the human condition in our modern, chaotic world. His writing style was to use\nshort, declarative sentences to describe the surreal and the absurd, and in so doing, effectively, I think, convey the feeling of an experience versus simply describing the experience. For example, famously, his work, \"The Metamorphosis\" opens with the following lines, \"As Gregor Samsa awoke one\nmorning from uneasy dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying in his\nhard, armor-plated back, and when he lifted his head a little, he could see his dome-like brown belly divided into stiff arched segments, on top of which the bed quilt\ncould hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes.\" Kafka, I think,\neffectively uses this image of being transformed into a\ngiant bug stuck on his back to convey a feeling of helplessness and uselessness to his family, to his job, to society. The feeling of being a burden to everyone, dehumanized, alienated, and abandoned, the feeling of being\nonly temporarily valued as long as he served some function for his job or for his family, and quickly discarded otherwise. I will probably talk about\nthis work in more depth at another time, because it is so haunting and I think it is such\na profound description of the burden of existence\nin modern society for many people. But here, lemme talk about\nanother of his work, \"The Trial.\" In this novel, the main\ncharacter, Josef K, is a successful bank officer, and he's arrested on his\nbirthday for an unspecified crime by a kind of amorphous court whose authority is everywhere and nowhere. He navigates a labyrinth-like legal system where everyone knows about his case, but no one can really explain it. The so-called trial never actually occurs in\nany conventional sense. Instead, Josef K's entire life becomes the proceedings\nleading up to the trial. In a sense, \"The Trial\" is the state of being accused itself, a permanent condition rather\nthan a singular event. Kafka's genius in this work was to show that modern institutions\ndon't need to hold trials, they just need to hold you in the permanent looming\npossibility of one. Public attention to this case, both positive and negative, gives Josef K a feeling of constantly being judged\nby people around him. This wears at his mind and his psychological wellbeing\nbegins to deteriorate. In a sense, the trial\ndoesn't need to convict him. The internal psychological turmoil and the external social\nscrutiny performs a conviction and the eventual execution. And exactly one year after his arrest, Josef K is visited by two men who walk him courteously through the city to an abandoned quarry and stab him in the heart, without Josef K resisting. To me, \"The Trial\" shows that tyranny's final victory\nisn't when it kills you, but when you hold still for the knife, not because you're forced, but because you've been\nexhausted into submission. Once again, it is a haunting story of the soullessness of bureaucracy and its suffocation of the human spirit. I highly recommend this short book, and I'll probably talk about\nit even more in the future. I don't think it's\nespecially useful for me to speak any parallels between \"The Trial\" and Pavel Durov's case, because after all, \"The\nTrial\" is a work of fiction. But on a positive note, let me\nreport that as far as I saw, Pavel has maintained optimism and a general positive outlook throughout this whole process. What I always fear in such cases is that a bureaucratic\nsystem can wear people down, exhaust them into surrendering. I saw none of that with Pavel. I don't think he knows\nhow to give up or give in, no matter how much pressure he's under. Again, this is truly inspiring to me. Also, now that we're talking about it, let me mention some other of Kafka's work that was moving to me, \"The Castle.\" A similar description as \"The Trial\" does of the absurd inaccessibility\nof those in authority of the nightmarish bureaucracy. The character in \"The\nCastle\" is also named K. Both bureaucracies operate\nthrough exhaustion, endless deferrals,\nprocedures, waiting rooms. Again, highly relevant to modern times. I can also highly recommend Kafka's \"In the Penal Colony\" and \"Hunger Artist.\" Both are too interesting and weird to explain in depth here. But let me say, \"The\nHunger Artist\" is a story that I think is relevant to our modern-day attention economy, where so many people want to be famous. It tells the story of a,\nlet's say, professional faster who performs starvation in\na cage as entertainment, and he slowly loses his\naudience to newer spectacles, so much so that eventually when he starves himself to death, nobody cares. Kafka's work is heavy. It serves as a warning for the nightmare that civilization can become, and yet I think it is\nalso a source of optimism, because when we can recognize elements of our own world in Kafka's stories, when we can see elements\nof our institutions in \"The Trial\" or in \"The Castle,\" when we can see ourselves in Gregor Samsa, we're not just diagnosing the disease, we're proving that we're still human and wise enough to see it and name it. Kafka gave us the goal to resist against such systems\nthat try to dehumanize us and to ensure that individual freedom and the human spirit keep flourishing. I think it will. I have faith in us humans. I love you all.",
