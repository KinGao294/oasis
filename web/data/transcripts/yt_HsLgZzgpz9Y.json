  "full_text": "- The following is a conversation with Dave\nPlummer, programmer and an old-school Microsoft software engineer who helped\nwork on Windows 95, NT, and XP, building a lot of incredible tools, some\nof which have been continuously used by hundreds of millions of people,\nlike the famed Windows Task Manager. Yes, the Windows Task Manager, and the zip/unzip compression support\nin Windows. And he ported the code for Space Cadet Pinball,\nAKA 3D Pinball to Windows. Today, he's loved by many programmers and engineers for his amazing YouTube\nchannel called Dave's Garage. You should definitely go check\nit out. Also, he wrote a book on autism and about his life\nstory, called Secrets of the Autistic Millionaire, where\nhe gives really interesting insights about how to navigate\nrelationships, career, and day-to-day life with autism. All this taken together, this was a super fun conversation\nabout the history and future of programming, computing, technology, and\njust building cool stuff in the proverbial garage. This is the Lex Fridman\nPodcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in\nthe description, and now, dear friends, here's Dave Plummer. Tell me about\nyour first computer. Do you remember? - I do. I didn't own my first computer for a long\ntime, but the first computer I ever used was a TRS-80 Model 1, Level 1, 4K\nmachine, and I rode my bike in fifth or sixth grade, so I was\nabout 11, to the local RadioShack. And, you know, they had the standard component\nstereo systems, everything else RadioShack had, but they had a stack of boxes that was labeled \"computer,\"\nand so I was asking the people who worked there about it, and they said they just got\nit and they hadn't set it up yet. And so I was rather precocious and I figured, \"Well,\nI'll set it up for you,\" and they said, \"Okay. Have a shot.\" (laughs) - Did you know what you were doing? - Absolutely not. I mean, it's no worse than a component\nstereo. The only thing is that Tandy, in their infinite wisdom, used the same five-pin DIN\nconnector for power, video, and I think cassette, so they were all identical, and\nif you plugged them in wrong, you'd blow it up. So I read the label and got it working and wound up playing\nwith it and not knowing anything about computers, so I'm typing English commands into\nit and, you know, PRINT 2+2 works perfectly, yet more simple English that\nyou enter into a Basic Level 1 interpreter is not going\nto get you very far. - So you're trying to talk to it in English? - Didn't know any better. And I still have an\nold foolscap that I wrote in sixth grade of a program that's kind of\nillogically correct but has no chance of working on any interpreter\nthat existed at the time, so it took me a while to figure out what was actually going\non with them. But I rode my bike down there every Thursday and Saturday, and they were\ngracious to let me use the machine. - When was this? - '79, '80. - Okay. What was the state of the art of computing\nback then? So what are we talking about? - Well, the big three had come out. There\nwas the TRS-80 Model 1, there was the PET 2001, and the Apple II came\nout roughly simultaneously. - Apple II. Would you say that's\nthe greatest computer ever built? - Probably in retrospect. Well, I would\nprobably give that to the Commodore 64. - Yeah. You and I agree on this,\nthat that was my first computer probably many years after it was released,\nbut yeah, Commodore 64's incredible. But yes, Apple II had a huge impact\non the history of personal computers. - Right. It's hard to gauge the\nlong-term impact, but I think the 64 itself probably influenced more people,\nso that's my reason for picking that one. - You think so? - The sales were certainly higher. - So Commodore 64 sold a lot? - Yeah. I mean, the numbers are hard to believe. It\ndepends which numbers you believe, but even the medium estimates were pretty high. - All right, cool. So you eventually\ngraduated to the Commodore 64. Tell me about that machine. What\ndid you do on the Commodore 64? - Well, the first thing I did was overheat the\nfloppy drive on it, which was unfortunate, because it wasn't a warranty machine.\nMy parents didn't have a lot of money, so we bought it from Computer House as opposed\nto one of the major retailers, which meant when it died, it had to go back to Germany\nor something to be fixed. So I was left with no floppy, and so I had a cassette deck,\nwhich was the best you could do at the time, and so I was writing small things, and I had a\nmachine language monitor that you could load from cassette. It didn't have an assembler built\nin, but it had a disassembler, so you could enter the op codes in 6502 in hex, and if you were\ncareful about planning, you'd be able to write some basic programs. So\nthat's kind of how I learned. The first thing I ever wrote on it was a clone\nof Galaga. Now, it's a bad clone of Galaga, but it has the major enemies that attack\nover time, and it's all written in hand-coded machine language, and you can't\nrelocate 6502, so if you need to add code in the middle, you need to manually sort\nof jump to somewhere else, do your work, jump back to where you were. It's just\nhideous spaghetti code, but it all worked eventually, and I went to make a\nbackup of it to preserve it for future scholars, or whatever\nthe hell I was doing. And I copied my blank\nfloppy onto my data floppy. So that was my first experience\nwith data management. - Oh, no. - So I don't have a copy of\nmy first program anymore. - What was that feeling like,\nof just doing something, if I may say so, like stupid,\nyou know? Which is a part of the programming experience. - Yeah, there was a huge amount of guilt\nbecause, right, you destroyed several weeks - Yeah. - of work, and you know it\nwas because you rushed, - Yeah. - or you did something stupid,\nor you made an unwise choice. - Can you tell me about the\nprogramming involved in that game? - So it's literally machine language. - So machine... so it's not even assembly? - Not assembly yet, because there was no\nassembler built in. So I should have written an assembler, written in assembler as my\nfirst task, but I wasn't that clever, so... - How hard is that to do? - Trivial, and it's one of those things\nthat sticks, I think. You do it so many times. You know, if I give you a C\nissue, there are certain syntactic issues in C that you're never\ngoing to forget and get wrong. And it's just one of those. - Like, what are the limitations of programming\nin machine code, as a programmer? - The biggest issue is you have to write\ncompletely sequentially because at least in that variant, 6502, you can't add things\nlater. You can only add things on the end. So it's like\nprogramming a tape in a way. - What was the most complicated thing\nyou've built with machine language? - That game would be. I mean, in assembly\nlanguage, I've done a fair bit of complicated stuff, but in actual machine language, I think\nthat game would be the only thing I've actually... - You literally built a game. - Not a great game, but it worked. - Okay. All right. And then you erased it? - I did. - All right. When did you first fall in\nlove with programming? When you figured out, like, this is something special. - I think there were two stages for me. I always\nknew immediately that I was fascinated with these machines, from the TRS-80 Model I. All\nI wanted to do was ride my bike back there and have more time with it. And I did that\nto wear out my welcome as much as I could. And the other revelation came, I think, about\nthe second or third year of university, when I realized, \"I love programming,\nbut I have no idea what I'm going to do. Am I going to make the 12 flash on a VCR somewhere?\nOr am I going to go work on an operating system? I have absolutely no idea what I'm\ngoing to do post-graduation. But I love what I do.\" And so, I think\nthat was a lot of consolation. It's like, it doesn't really matter what I'm doing at\nthis point, because I kind of love doing it, so... - So, you'll figure it out. As long as you're following this\nkind of feeling that's telling you- - I knew I was in the right\narea, finally. Yeah. - Yeah. All right. You\ndropped out of high school. - Yeah. Not the smartest move. - Okay. But you ended up going back to\nschool and being very successful at school and, just in general, successful as\na programmer, as a developer, as a creator of software. How were you able to find your way? Can you tell\nthat journey of dropping out- ... and then finding your way back? - There's no moment when I dropped out. You just\ngo less and less and less until you realize it's going to be embarrassing if I show up\ncause I haven't been there in a long time. And then pretty soon you're just not going,\nand that's how you drop out of high school. So, if you find yourself on that path, stop\ndoing that. But that's precisely what I did. And so now I'm not at school, and I have to get\na job, so I'm working at 7-Eleven and a paint warehouse and stuff like that. And 7-Eleven\nis actually kind of an interesting job, because it's a job I think they keep\nrotating for people that are smart enough to do the night shift with all the accounting and the\nadministration and stuff they make the night shift do, but that have reasons personally\nthat they need to work at 7-Eleven. And I was one of those people,\ncause I had no high school diploma. - What are some memorable moments from\nthat time at 7-Eleven? Well, maybe what do you appreciate about\nthe difficulty of that job? - Probably the worst moment for me, I mean, I got held up\nat knife-point and stuff, and that's all entertaining, but the worst... The most, the suckiest\npart for me was doing the gas dips. We've got a long, it's like a 15 or 20-foot\nwooden stick and it's measured in gradients of inches and feet, and you drop it\ninto the gasoline tanks and then you bring it up and you measure where the gasoline sits,\ncause there's no electronic sensor. So, I'm doing that and the first time I\ndo it, I drop the pole and I re-grab it. Well, that's about a thousand splinters\nof wood into your hands, and it's 40 below out, and that really sucked. - Oh, wow. - And I realized, \"I don't want to do this\nfor a whole life.\" I knew that, so... - Okay. So you stand there frozen\nwith splinters in your hand. - And at some point, I have a\nrevelation about my life that next time I'm going to do it differently.\nAnd then how ludicrous that is hits me about three seconds later, right? And I think that was really the moment for me where\nI realized that I've got to do something different. And so even though I was 21, I went and I\ntalked to the principal of my local high school, and I was like, \"Can you let me\nback in?\" And he's, \"No, you're too old and we don't have room,\" was\nhis main reason. And I said, \"Well, between now and then, somebody's\ngoing to drop out. So you'll have room. So let's assume you have room. Can I come back?\"\nAnd he was gracious and let me come back. And so I did the three or\nfour classes that I needed. - Yeah, you know, just if you can\nlinger on that, the slow dropping out. That's a weird thing that\nyou can do with your brain. You realize to yourself that you don't have\nto do the thing that everybody else is doing, and that's a dangerous\nrealization because like, you kind of have to be part\nof society to do certain things. - Right. - And if you realize like you don't\nhave to do what everybody else is doing, you can either have an incredible\nlife or a really difficult life. - Well, the problem with that process is you're making a\nmuch smaller decision. \"I'm just not gonna go to class today.\" - Yeah. - And that's all you're deciding, but you do that\nenough times, you're making a much bigger decision. And that's the problem. - So it's better to make... If you want to\nlive life in a non-standard way, it's better to make the big decision\nexplicitly, and then you can stop going. - Yeah. - Don't allow yourself to\nmake the slip-ups, though. - It'll be made for you eventually. - Yeah. Okay. Well, you got back,\nand you eventually went to college and were very successful as a student,\nand you weren't that good of a student before. - No, I was a terrible student in high\nschool, and even my first semester of college, I still wasn't taking it quite\nseriously because I got mercy passed in Geometry 90, which is like the makeup class for the\nGeometry 12th grade class that I didn't have. And that scared me 'cause I\nrealized by 1%, or the grace of the professor that let me through,\nI just about ended my entire university career here. So fortunately, those marks\ndon't count on your transcript 'cause they're remedial classes, and so I got kind of a\nfresh start the next semester and did it for real, and I did it for me,\nand that made all the difference. - What can you speak to, maybe by way of\nadvice, on how to be successful as a student? - Well, ideally there's some aspect of school\nthat you do enjoy, whether it's art, whether it's computer science, whether it's shop\nclass, whatever. So go for those classes and and just put up with and do the hard stuff\nbecause it's way easier than having to do it later. That's easy to say when you're\n50-something; it's harder when you're 15-something, but... ...It\nmakes a lot of sense. - All right. What's the story of you\njoining Microsoft? How did we get there from 7-Eleven to Microsoft? - Yeah, it's a big jump. So I had gone\nback to school, and I think it was in my third year of university. I was working for\nthe phone company for the summer as a job, doing conversions of their\nUBNet to TCP/IP and modern networking, which really amounts to swapping\ncards but then figuring out why their config.sys doesn't allow Lotus to run anymore\nbecause it's got 10K less than it used to. It's just a horrible time to be working\nin computers, but I was doing it. And at lunch, I'm sitting in the food court with the\nold and the bored, and I'm reading a book that I had bought called \"Microsoft,\nor Bill Gates, and the Making of Microsoft Hard Drive,\" I think is\nthe title. And it's a great book. It's just a matter-of-fact history of how\nMicrosoft came to be, what it's like, how it operates, what the people are like\nthere. And I'm reading this book and I become really entranced by it and fascinated\nbecause it sounds like exactly the place I want to be. But I'm in Saskatchewan, so\nwhat am I going to do about it? What I wound up doing was, I had put myself\nthrough school with a program called HyperCache, which is a file system cache for the\nAmiga because the Amiga didn't have any out of the box. And it had\ndone reasonably well. So I went through my registration cards, because\nin those days you had a four-by-six card that people had to fill out with their name\nand their address, and if they had an email, their email, and they'd send it in. They'd get\nnotifications of updates and so on. It's shareware. And I went through the whole stack looking\nfor anybody with a Microsoft email address. And I found maybe three or four people,\nand I just cold-emailed them and said, \"Hey, I'm an operating system student in\nSaskatchewan looking for an opportunity.\" I don't remember exactly what I said.\nBut one guy, Alasdair, Alasdair Banks, he wrote back and he said, \"I know\nsomebody that I can put you in contact with.\" And he put me in contact, I think, with a guy\nnamed Ben Slifka, who did a phone interview, who eventually wanted to hire me\nto work on MS-DOS for the summer. So that's how I got there. - You put yourself through school\nby... Tell me about HyperCache. You built a piece of software... - It's the weight-loss\nprogram for hard drives. - That was sufficiently useful to a large number of people that\nwould somehow give you money? - Yeah, it made decent money. I mean,\nI sold a couple thousand copies. At 20 bucks a copy or 40 bucks\na copy depending on the rules. - What language was it written in? - C. - C. - So there were some assemblers. The actual really\ntight code to do the real work of transferring data to and from the cache was 68,000\nassembly. Everything else was C. - Okay. This is like file system I/O? - Device block I/O. Any block that gets\nserviced from the drive would go through my cache first, and it was an N-way associative cache,\nso it would try to match the geometry of the the geometry of the drive and do pre-fetch\nbased on you're trying to read a whole track at one time, that kind of thing. - What was it like trying\nto get your software out there at that time? Like, how\nwere you able to find customers? - Yeah, it's interesting. I think I started\non Usenet and some of the Amiga forums, posted, \"Here's my trial version, try\nit out for 30 days, see what you like.\" And eventually it got picked up by a few\nretailers, and I remember I was with my now wife in her car, and she had a cell phone,\ncause her dad was very concerned about her safety. And so this is late '80s, and\nshe's got, you know, the antenna on the roof and the big box in the trunk, the\nwhole deal. But we got a call from one of the software retailers that\nwanted to buy 50 copies at 20 bucks, which to me is a thousand bucks,\nwhich in 1989 or whatever year it is was a big deal. And so eventually a number\nof companies just bought inventory. - Let's go to that time. It's such an interesting\ntime with Bill Gates and Microsoft. Why do you think Microsoft was dominating the\nsoftware and the personal computing space at that time and really for\nmany, many, many years after? - At the time, it was the single\nmost potent assemblage of smart people that I've ever been a part of.\nAnd I've been in academia and I've been in industry to a certain extent, and you know, when you're working at a regular\ncomputer company, the one guy who actually knows what he's doing, his smarter friend?\nHe probably works at Microsoft. So when you get there, you're the big cheese from your\nsmall town, you think you know a lot, and all of a sudden, you're just in an environment\nwhere you're like, \"Uh-oh, I'm just not gonna - Mm-hmm. Okay. What about Bill\nGates himself? What are some qualities of Bill Gates that you think\ncontribute to the success of Microsoft? - I think he was relentless in the pursuit\nof his one dream, which was his old slogan of a computer in every home and\na computer on every desk. It was his special interest, and he was a smart guy,\nsuper determined, and he hired people that were as smart or smarter than him to\nhelp him execute it. And he built an almost unstoppable machine\nof intellect to go forth and make, let's say, very\nsimple products. MS-DOS is not a complicated product by any\nstretch, but it's exactly what the market needed at that time. - Yeah, I mean, MS-DOS\nchanged the game. And, that's actually the team you joined,\nthe MS-DOS team, and I think you joined before Windows 95 was released. So tell me about\nthe story of MS-DOS. Its success of MS-DOS is probably\npivotal to the success of Microsoft. - Yeah, before DOS, they were largely a\nlanguage company, so they had made BASIC for a lot of computers and they had a\nFortran compiler and a Pascal compiler, that kind of thing. But their deal to\nhave MS-DOS included with every version or every instance of the PC effectively\nset them as a standard that they were able to leverage for\ndecades going forward. And to a certain extent, they lucked into\nthat, and on the other hand, they were smart to have done it. They\ndidn't charge IBM a lot of money for it, but making it a standard really played out to their\nadvantage over time. - So at that time, MS-DOS, no\ngraphical interface. Can you just speak to what the heck MS-DOS is? - It's largely a command launcher. You type in a\nname of a command. It looks it up to see if that's in the current directory or on a special\npath of folders, and it loads it into memory and executes it if it's there. That's 90% of what MS-DOS does. It\nhas environment variables and some complexity and a small scripting language built\nin, but it is basically just an operating system shell that allows you to use the\nresources of the computer, like the hard drive or the CPU. It doesn't allow\nyou to multitask. There's no graphical interface. Microsoft\ndid add a text-based graphical interface for things like\nan editor and QuickBASIC in DOS 5.0, I believe. And there was\na DOS shell, which was sort of a graphical file manager\nin MS-DOS 4.0. So they experimented with it, but it's\nlargely a command prompt. - Does it have the ability to\ncommunicate with external devices, so drivers and all that kind of\nstuff? How expansive of an operating system was MS-DOS? - It was limited by the original x86\ninstruction set, which limited it to 640K. - Right. - And then there were various Band-Aids on top of\nthat to do high memory and then extended memory beyond that, and A lot of hoops have to be jumped through to\nmake anything work without consuming base RAM. - Yeah, I mean, you programmed on\nMS-DOS. What's it like? What are some interesting details there? Like you\nsaid, there's the memory constraints of 640 kilobytes. - Yeah, 640K is the maximum that's ever gonna\nbe available, so it's not what's available to you as an operating system developer, because\nwhatever you use is what the user won't get. So if you use 10K needlessly, you're\ngonna... Every machine in the world now has 10K less, so it's\nkind of a big responsibility. - Is that a true quote from\nBill Gates, where he said, - \"Nobody will ever need more than 640K\"? - Yeah. - Yeah, no, it's not him. - Okay. - It's been attributed to him, but not real. - Okay. So what are some interesting\naspects of what you were able to do as an intern and when you\njoined on MS-DOS and beyond? - One of the first things I did was to take SmartDrive,\nthe disk cache, because I had familiarity with disk caches- and to add CD-ROM caching to\nit, because that was new. CD-ROMs were just coming out. Microsoft Bookshelf is\none of the few products you could run for it. And as you can imagine, caching\na CD speeds it up by dozens of times if you're smart about it. So it was a\nbig performance win and a nice thing to work on. A bigger part of that\nwas moving a bunch of SmartDrive and eventually the double-space\ncompression engine up into what's known as high memory. And without rat-holing on the technical\naspect of it, on the x86, there's something I believe called the A20 line. I probably\nhave this backwards, or I got a 50-50 shot at it, but if you've got the A20 line asserted, then\nyour memory pointers wrap at the one megabyte mark. If not, they don't, so you\ncontinue going up in memory. You can rewrite memory above by combining\nyour segment and offset registers to a number bigger than one\nmegabyte, and you get an extra 64K. You put your code in there, and\nthen you just put stubs to jump to it from low memory. You can get another\n64K out of the machine that way, and we did that for a couple\nof products. And that's... I had no idea what HIMEM was, 'cause I was an Amiga\nprogrammer and I'd never written any x86 code before I got there, so... - So that was, like, a cool\noptimization you got to be a part of. So what about Windows? There was a\nparallel development of Windows 95, right? At that time, did you get a chance\nto interact with those folks? - I actually worked on Windows 95 for about three\nor four months. I was on the COM/OLA team doing the presentation cache, which\nis when you insert, say, a Word or an Excel spreadsheet or chart into a Word document. You don't want Excel to have to be\nloaded to render it every time, so there's a presentation cache of enhanced metafiles\nand I was working on that. So that shipped in Windows 95, but I\nmoved to the Shell team about six months after getting to Microsoft,\nso I worked on NT from there forward. - Okay, and what's 95? What's NT? - Windows 95 is an evolution of\nthe original 16-bit Windows 3.1, which was the very first\npopular version of Windows. It adds 32-bit support, then VxD\ndrivers and a bunch of new technology, and an entirely new user interface.\nIt's something that at the time was revolutionary. People lined up at night\nto wait in line to buy the thing. - Can you just take us back to that\ntime and describe why 95 was such a big leap from 3.1? So Apple\nalready had a graphical interface. Windows 3.1 had a graphical interface.\nWhy was Windows 95 such a gigantic leap? - I don't want to make it as basic\nas the Start menu, but I think... ...it's a big part of it. I\nknow when I first saw it... ...I couldn't quantify what about it was different\nand awesome, but I realized that I wanted to be a part of it, and that's why I started\nwriting a Shell extension, which became zip folders at some point. But I was just fascinated by the new Shell, and that's\nwhy I wound up working on the team that brought that Shell over to NT and\nwhat's Windows today. - Would you say that's the greatest operating system ever? What's the\nmost impactful operating system ever? - Windows 95 would be number two for me. I\nthink OS/360 is going to be number one. - Okay, interesting. - 'Cause you could take a machine and\nwrite a COBOL program for it in 1962, jump in your time machine, go\nto Poughkeepsie and boot up an IBM z17 mainframe and run it today. And\nthey've been doing it for however many years, that is. And it's\nall on the business side, so we as consumers don't have much access\nto it, but I think it was probably as influential in the commercial side\nas Windows 95 was in the home side. And then probably Linux would be\nnumber three for me. I put Linux as b- as bigger than Unix, which doesn't work 'cause\nyou can't have one without the other, but the impact of Unix, BSD, and so\nforth, is largely in the academic space. It's by programmers\nfor programmers. - So yeah, Linux created... I mean, it was\nthe embodiment of the open-source spirit at its largest scale, all right?\nSo it's almost created a community and it created a spirit of\nprogramming that propagates to this day. That's true. That's\ntrue. Like scale matters. - Yeah, and its penetration on the server side of\nthings now is, I don't know if it's equivalent to what System/360 achieved, but\nit's almost ubiquitous, so... - Yeah, the world... I mean, this is\nthe quiet secret of the universe, is it runs on Linux. Okay, so tell, tell\nme about your work days. What were they like back then, back in\nthe MS-DOS and Windows 95 days? Take me through a productive day. - Well, your day starts coming in,\nand you got to download the address book, which is... Microsoft has\nbetween 10 and 15,000 employees at this point, and we're all on MS\nMail. We're just getting off of the PDP-11 called Miss Piggy,\nwhich ran Whizmail and we're running MS Mail. But\nMS Mail has a fixed address book that every user must download every morning,\nand when there's 10,000 people downloading 10,000 people, it gets pretty messy.\nAnd I think we're on 10-megabit networking at the time, so your first hour is\ndownloading the address book, which was always frustrating. But you'd use that time to look at\nthe crashes that would have happened overnight from a process we called Stress, which\nis NNT... All the machines that are unused run tests all night\nlong, and they try to crash themselves, and if they manage to crash\nthemselves, it will drop into a debugger with a serial cable to another machine, and you can connect\nto that other machine and remotely debug the crashed machine. So you come in, and\nthey will have triaged bugs, you know, there was a crash in the Start\nmenu, so we'll assign that to Dave, and so you come in and that's your first thing, is to connect,\n'cause you got to get that machine back to the guy that owns it and unlock the machine, so\nthat's your first hour of your day, is basically triage for bugs that\nhave come up from Stress overnight and then at that point it's probably\nback to coding, which unfortunately 80% of the time is fixing bugs, especially\nin my career, it was porting code and fixing bugs, I wasn't writing a lot of new code, and\nthere were exceptions, I wrote a lot of new code on the side to get it out of my system. From a day-to-day grind of always\nfixing bugs in other people's code, which is amazing\nlearning experience. - So you did a lot of the... At\nMicrosoft, you did a lot of the porting of, what is it?\nWindows 95 code to NT? - Yeah. We took the entire Windows 95 user\ninterface, and we ported it to NT, which meant making it Unicode, for one thing. So\neverything that was eight bits is now 16 bits, so... - Okay. - ...pointers. It's quite a mess when you\nswitch the code over, as you can imagine. - Can you give us insights into\nwhat is involved in porting? - It's like breaking into somebody's house and going through\nall their stuff and seeing the stuff in their drawers that they didn't want you to see. You find all the good stuff, the\npretty pictures hanging on the wall, and you find some disturbing\nstuff in the nightstand. I saw code that was, like, 200 characters\nwide with profanity and swears in it, and it eventually got all cleaned up\nover the years by the time I left. But it was not always the most\nprofessional code in the world. - Right, because every single piece\nof code you have to go through. - Line by line, so you see it all. - Yeah. I mean, that's\nthe, that's the story of programmers. You write a piece\nof code and you think it'll never, it'll never be seen\nby anybody. And sometimes, oftentimes, that code is going to be\nseen by a very large number of people. ...that come after you,\nincluding you five years later. You yourself looking at your own code. Okay, so tell me about Windows\nNT. That was a giant leap too. - It was. It was basically a clean-sheet\ndesign. So they went and they got Dave Cutler from Digital Equipment, who had\ndone operating systems for them, VMS and RSX-11, he had\ndone. And so he came over after, I believe it was Prism\nand MICA were some projects at DEC West that got canceled. And so\nyou had a whole team of guys where their project is canceled, and basically, they\ntook a whole bunch of them and came to Microsoft. And I don't know the specifics of the deal, but\nthey all showed up. So you had Dave Cutler and Mark Lucovsky and all these really smart\nguys from DEC, and they did basically a clean sheet, but they also\nhad OS/2 as a starting point. But OS/2 was, of course, written in assembly\nlanguage, and NT is going to be written in C. So To what extent they were able to leverage any of\nthat, I don't actually know, but at least they had a system to start with. - You said that Dave Cutler's the man, the\nmind behind Windows. Can you explain? - So Dave Cutler is the architect\nof the kernel. So he is Linus in the Linux world. It's Dave\nC. in the Windows world. - Yeah. Dave C., okay. - And it's not that there weren't other\npeople that contributed huge pieces to it. But I think he's the driving force\nbehind it and always largely has been. And he's still... I think he's\n85 now. He still codes every day. He's a Microsoft Fellow. As far as\nI know, he still goes in to work. - Can you speak to the genius of\nthat guy? What's interesting interesting about his mind, having, having\nworked with him, having interacted with Dave Cutler? - Well, the dude's wicked smart,\nbut he's also like a farmer. He's the guy that will follow you around\nand make sure that stuff gets done and gets done right to make sure that you're not\nchecking any crap into his operating system. And he won't tolerate it. He's a\nreal taskmaster in that regard, but I think it really paid off because it was a very\nbig paradigm shift for Microsoft developers to be subjected to the Dave Cutler, Digital\nEquipment style of leadership. - What did you learn from that\nabout successful software teams, where there's a large number of people\ncollaborating? Because Microsoft had a lot of brilliant engineers back then, and like\nyou said, Dave Cutler. They had to, they had to create completely new systems, many of which we still use\ntoday. What have you learned about great software engineering\nteams from that time? - Tools are everything, I think, for\none. And people are everything. We'll give that as a granted. But\nthe tool set is a huge factor. If we had Git, it would have been\nimmensely easier. We were using Diff and, you know, manual Deltas. To do this porting and stuff. So being\nable to fork a branch of source code would be a luxury that\nis new to me. And so- At the time, it would\nhave been really handy. - What were some memorable conversations\nfrom that time when you walked over next door- - Well, what- - and talked to some of these folks? - I was not present for was, somebody was\ncomplaining, a new hire came into the team and was working on what I\nbelieve was called Cairo. And Cairo was going to be the next future operating system, was\ngoing to be beautiful, and have a whole new user interface newer than Windows 95, and it never materialized.\nBut while they were working on it, one of the guys that was working on Cairo\nwas kind of flaming on the open NT dev alias, which is thousands of people,\nhow shitty the NT boot experience was. And the response that came back was, an epic flame that I wish I would have saved,\nand I won't name the guy who wrote it. He knows who he is, but- It was a work of art of angry flame mail,\nkind of like the ones you see Linus send every now and then about kernel stuff.\nSo it's a very similar sentiment. - Were there, like, kind\nof intellectual debates, - Oh yeah. - like, there's some heated\nstuff with the engineers? - It was... Yeah, it got contentious.\nSo you've got intellects competing, and eventually, the technical merits for\nsome people are secondary, and it's about besting the other person in that\nargument, and it's no longer productive at that point half the time, but\nthere was a fair bit of that. - Yeah, I've seen those kind of\ndebates in like, programming language design communities,\nlike Guido van Rossum, the leaders of those communities, it\ncan wear them down because people get... You almost, like,\nforget the mission you're on and start being very\nnitpicky about the details. I mean, engineering minds get together, and you just go to war over\nthe stupidest, like, syntax subtlety. - Right. - Well, I shouldn't say stupid,\nbut it's a small syntax. subtlety for programming language.\nI'm sure there are internal battles about specific kernel components. - Yeah, there's one that I lost\nthat still bugs me to this day. - Okay, yeah. - Because I still think I was right. When we were doing\nthe shell, we were porting everything from ANSI to Unicode, so every character that was\neight bits now becomes 16 bits. Now, the problem is I'm on a MIPS box\nbecause I'm porting it to RISC. And you can't have unaligned addresses. But if you\ntake two ID lists, which are basically past components, you take the one for C: backslash,\ntake the one for Windows, take the one for System32, and you add them together.\nBut if you've got an odd number of characters, now you're at an odd address in this\nthing, and it takes me an immense amount of work to turn on exception handlers\nto do unaligned byte access, to pull the string out and copy it\nmanually. And it's literally like a hundred to a thousand times the amount\nof work to read a string out of this ID list on a MIPS machine because\nit's unaligned. So I'm having the argument that even though it's late in Windows\n95, they've already shipped one beta that we should now just guarantee that ID lists are\nalways an even number of bytes, or do some hack to just make sure this never happens\nso the code that references them on all this hard work can just blaze\nthrough it. And it became a shouting match and sort of a personal match,\nand I lost that one. And I still think that, I know today, that that code\nrunning on Windows is thousands of times slower than it has to be. Nobody\ncares because it's plenty fast, but - Yeah. - it could be a lot faster. - Yeah. So you mentioned MIPS and RISC. How deeply did you have to\nunderstand the lowest level? Sort of the lowest\nlevel of the software and even the hardware with the stuff\nyou were building. Like, what are the layers of the abstractions\nyou had to understand to be successful with all the stuff you're\ndoing with NT and before that? - Well, about half your day is going to be spent\ndebugging, and most of the time is going to be spent in call stacks that are in pure assembly\nlanguage because there's no source level debugging. So it's not like we're in Visual Studio and you hit\na breakpoint and it pops up and there's the source code. You can go look at the source code, but you're\nlooking at the raw assembly dump from the machine at all times. - So even if you're programming in\nC, the debugging is in assembly? - Yeah, 100%. - Oh man. - So it's a little cumbersome. And better yet, we're doing four\ninstruction sets because we're doing Intel, MIPS, Alpha, and PowerPC. So depending\non which machine it crashes on, you've got an entirely different instruction set. You get reasonably adept\nat debugging all four, but I had more experience in MIPS,\nso MIPS stuff would come my way. - That's a real endurance event. Can you\nspeak to that? The torture there is debugging, especially that kind of debugging\nwithout the tooling associated with it? I mean, that's, you know, programming. Kids\nthese days, programming isn't all about creating beautiful things, right?\nIt's also about fixing things. - Yeah, I would say that 20% of my professional\nlife has been creating, and 80% has been debugging and fixing. And I mean, I got a bit of a reputation\nas somebody who could fix stuff. So stuff like that would flow to me, and so I would\nspend more time doing that. I wasn't renowned as a creative UI genius where I'm flowering all\nthese new ideas. So I got to fix ugly stuff, but you get really good at that. So I don't\nmind it until it's one of those things where you've been chasing it for so long that you\ndon't know what to do next, and you can't understand why it doesn't work, or how it\never worked, or whatever situation you happen to be in, and after a day of\nit, it can get pretty trying. - Yeah, debugging can be real torture.\nIt can be really, really difficult. There's a psychological component,\nI think, of perseverance. - I think the ones that take you a day, they\nresolve one of two ways. Either it's like, \"Oh, extra semicolon,\" and\nthen you finally see it. Or it's some horrible manifestation\nof cross-threaded apartment nonsense that was really hard. But it\ncan go both ways. I had a bug. It wasn't my bug, actually, but it was\na manifestation of a bug in Task Manager where every now and then it would say\ngreater than 100% total CPU usage, and this looks pretty silly for a\nTask Manager. So I had tried to resolve it for a long time, and I'd talked to\nthe kernel guys about my issue, and they were unsympathetic, let's say, because the kernel\nguys are a special breed, and they weren't interested in my user-land problems. It's\nprobably some issue in my code, right? And they're probably right, but it wasn't\nin this case, and I was sure of it. So I kept adding asserts all through\nthe code to make sure that the preparatory steps of adding the\nstuff together were never more than 100, and that the final sum was never\nmore than 100. And finally, it never asserted. But occasionally we would\nget this bug where people would still see it. So I finally put\nmy phone number in the assert, and I was like, \"If you see this message,\ncall DavePL at 425-836,\" my phone number. And finally, we did get a catch in the actual\nstress debugger that I was talking about earlier, where it happened to somebody with a\ndebugger connected. We were able to go through, and it was actually a kernel accounting issue, and it wasn't a\nTask Manager issue. So they just fixed it in the kernel once I was able to prove that it\nwas, in fact, a kernel issue. And you'd think we would then remove my phone\nnumber, but we just commented it out. So it's shipped, and it's in all the damn source\ncode leaks for NT that are out there. So - But that's awesome. - that's how I find Task Manager code is I search\nfor my phone number on Google, and it will reverse find- - Oh yeah, that's fantastic. - ... the NT source code. - Can you speak to the assert thing? By the\nway, I saw, I think you tweeted or you said somewhere that if you want to take your\nasserts really seriously, you add your home phone number in there-\nIt's true. It's true. - A little facetious, because it's\nprobably not the smartest thing, but... - No, it's not. - ...you will find out. - But I mean, assert by itself is already\na serious thing, because it stops all execution. I mean, this is one\nof the reasons I really, really love asserts, because they stop everything and\nforce you to take care of the problem. - Yeah, I'm a little religious about my asserts, too.\nI don't assert things that I hope aren't true. I assert things that I\nknow cannot be true. And I think that's really the intent of an\nassertion. So I'm overstating the obvious, but when it does occur, it's a bug,\nplain and simple. It's not a warning. - It's kind of fascinating how\noften it can really help you figure out the problem, because\nif you put asserts everywhere, you can get very quickly to\nthe source of the problem. - Yeah, I tend to... it's not something I\nwant to suggest you go back and add later. It's something you should do\norganically as you build your code. - As you're building. - So for each function, if you've got\nassumptions, like I know that this pointer is never null, well, assert that. If\nyou know this count is always less than twice the byte width, assert that. And\ndon't be afraid, because if it asserts, it's doing you a favor. I think some people\nare afraid. You know, it's like when you turn out of an intersection and you think maybe\nthere's somebody coming and you don't look left. Or maybe I'm one to do that. But\nit's like that. People don't assert because they're afraid they're\ngoing to fire. Well, no, you want to know. - You mentioned Task Manager.\nObviously, we have to talk about this, the legendary program that\nyou created, the Windows Task Manager. Tell me every detail of how you\nbuilt it. What is Windows Task Manager? - So Windows Task Manager is a way to go in\nand find out which apps on your system are using the computer, using the hardware,\nusing the CPU, using the memory, and which ones might be using too\nmuch or locked up, or going crazy. And it gives you the ability to\nterminate and kill those ones. So it's an inspection and a fixing tool. - Yeah, it lists all the processes. I mean,\nit's a legendary piece of software. It's crazy. We just take it for granted.\nIt's like the Start menu, right? It's like genius. - Well, I had the great fortune of working on a\nlot of things that people are familiar with. And Task Manager was one of those side projects\nthat I started as something that I wanted for myself and eventually came in-house.\nSo I started writing it at home, and I got kind of the basics up and\nrunning. And I was using, I think it's HKey Current Performance or HKey Performance in the\nregistry to get the stats, because I didn't have access to the internal APIs, because I\nwas working from home and I don't call those if I'm working from home. And when I brought it in-house,\nthen I was able to call things like NtQuerySystemInformation or\nNtQueryProcessInformation and get the real answers very quickly, which enabled it to\nbecome a very fast and responsive app. So people have come to rely on it because I wrote\nit to be as reliable as possible. I wasn't worried about the features. It was a basic set of\nfunctionality that I wanted in there. And I got everything I wanted, but I\nwanted it to be really robust. And so that... and small. The\noriginal was like 87k. - Okay, can you speak to what it takes to build\na piece of software like that that doesn't freeze? - You don't assume much, right? If\nyou're going to call the shell to run an app, well, that could be a network path\nthat's on a TCP/IP share that takes 90 seconds to time out. So\nanytime you do any kind of API call like that, that could take time, you're\ngoing to wind up doing it on a separate thread. And so the app becomes a little more complex\nbecause everything is multithreaded. - Okay, so what programming\nlanguage were you working in? - C++. - So this was for Windows NT? - Yes. - Okay. - So this shipped initially in NT 4.0. - Okay, so what are some interesting details about\nthis program? Because you have to get it as simple as possible, but also as robust as possible. What are some interesting\noptimizations, for example, you had to implement? - There are a couple of things. They're a\nlittle hardcore now. I'm surprised I did. I didn't want to link to the C runtimes at\nall. So I made sure never to call a runtime call and I didn't link to them, and that\nsaved me whatever the C runtime is, 96k or something. So, it almost doubled the\nsize of the app if you just touched any C call. So I was careful not to do that,\nbut then I was actually writing in C++, which is C with objects\nmore than anything. But, in order to get it to work, I had\nto go through and call all the object constructors manually from the dispatch table\nand stuff because you don't have the runtimes to do it for you. So you're working with a compiler that\ndoesn't have its runtime, and I don't want to rat hole on the technical issues, but it's a lot\nof extra work to get it to work, but when you do, it's incredibly small and tight. - That's about the size... ...of the program. What are some\ninteresting aspects of tracking down every process and how much\nCPU usage is in that process? - One of the cooler things that I saw is...\nI don't want to say I invented Hamming code, but I kind of invented Hamming code\nwithout knowing Hamming code existed. So every column and every row in Task\nManager has a bit on whether it's become dirty or not. Then I can look, basically\nthe same way Hamming code looks in your X and Y columns to find out which rows have changed,\ngo through and find out which ones actually need to be repainted. So Task Manager\nis super efficient, and it works in concert with the ListView control, which provides\nthat functionality to go through and repaint as little as an individual\ncell that changes from frame to frame. So it could paint very\nfast, it can resize very smoothly, and resizing was probably\nmy biggest personal goal with that app. So you can size\nit to any size and it still works and even if you have 32 CPUs,\nwhich wasn't possible in the day, it will draw, I think, only\neight graphs and then it wraps, but it still works today. So\nkind of proud of that. - It is incredible. Um, You've gotten the chance to observe\nthe evolution of Task Manager. In some ways, it really\nhasn't changed much. Maybe there are some prettier\naspects to it that fit into whatever version of Windows it's in, but\nit's really basically the same thing. - The functionality is very much the same.\nThe reporting is more because they've added GPU and thermals and things like\nthat, which is really nice to have. And we didn't have that\nability in the day. - I mean, what can you say? Do you\nknow, was there any refactoring done, or is it basically the same code? - As far as I know, the original code's still\nmostly all there. So there are layers of drawing code and dark mode code\nand whatever else, XML schema code that goes on top of that, that\nmakes it four megabytes instead of 87k. But that's the world we live in. - Yeah, it's one of those pieces of\nsoftware you create and once it's there, it's just really like the Start menu,\nand then I'm sure if you remove it, people would just lose their mind. - Yeah, it might be locked in for a\nwhile on that one. It might be good. - Yeah, I thought that would\nbe true for Clippy, but, Clippy will make it back one\nday. All right, what are some other pieces of software you created\nat the time that are legendary? So you were part of Space Cadet\nPinball, at least porting. - Yeah, so they came into my office and said,\n\"Hey, what are you doing?\" And I said, I told them what I was doing and\nthey said, \"Well, how do you want to spend your next three months?\"\nAnd I said, \"I have no idea.\" And they said, \"Do you want to port Pinball?\"\nAnd I had seen Space Cadet Pinball as a game standalone for the Win95 platform, and it had a\ncouple different tables, and it was a cool game. So I was kind of excited, and what they\nwanted was some visual splash for NT to show that NT can do, for then,\nhigh-speed graphics and, or at least, responsive graphics.\nAnd so I took a shot. And unfortunately, a lot of the code was\nin Assembly, and I was on a MIPS, so I had to rewrite the code in C, so that I\ncould then port it to all the different platforms. And at the heart of\nthe game is a huge state engine. And it's like a giant switch statement\nwith, if I remember, like 50 entries in it. like 50 entries in it. And it's got an\nEaster egg built in. And decoding the state, it's like running a neural\nnetwork through this thing as you hit it with different states. And I just put\nit aside and treated it as a black box. And so my code runs on top of that and does\nthe drawing and the sound and everything else. But the original game is still\nrunning. And somebody recently asked me, why is it slightly different?\nThe physics are slightly different from the Windows 95 version,\nbut it should be the same code because I'm trying very hard to preserve that.\nBut what it is, is I had a bug where I will draw as many frames per second as I\ncan, which on a modern computer can be 5,000 frames a second for Pinball\nbecause it's a pretty basic game. And so all your physics are interpolated\n5,000 times per second instead of 30 times a second, or whatever you would've got on\nthe old one. So you're getting arguably better, So you're getting arguably better,\nor at least different physics. - Why is that game so awesome? - I think it's a great design. I mean, I take no\ncredit for that. That's all totally the guys at Cinematronics. But the original game is a great\ndesign. It's very similar to Black Knight 2000, which I own as an actual\nphysical pinball machine. And the layout is actually very similar. I\ndon't know if it was inspired by it or not. game. - Yeah. Sometimes I think about like\nTetris, about certain games with pretty primitive graphics that captivate\nthe the excitement of a large number of people. And maybe it's the excitement of a large number of\npeople that contributes to the awesomeness of the game. So when many people together\nget excited and talk about it, that sort of gets implanted into your\nhead. But that's one of the great games. I mean, even like Solitaire and Minesweeper. I mean, there's just a\ngeneration of people that have gone to war in Minesweeper, right? - Well, those things were included in the OS\nnot as games but as educational tools to get you to use a mouse. - Oh, interesting. - So Solitaire is there to show\nyou how to do drag and drop. - Yeah. - And Minesweeper's probably right click.\nI think you put a flag or some item. - Yeah. - I'm not a Minesweeper guy, but so each\none of them teaches you something. - Minesweeper guy. That's\nfunny. Yeah. Wow, I didn't know that. That's\ninteresting. And that's true. But I don't know how many hours I've spent\non these games and like millions of people have spent millions of\nhours on these games. - I used to volunteer teaching computer science\nat my kids' school, you know, for the third graders and stuff. So it's more like\nlogging in than computer science. But the kids, of course, all their dads\nwork at Microsoft, so nobody's impressed by anything you do. So one of the kids found out\nI worked on Pinball and then they were like, \"Whoa, you worked on Pinball?\" Because\nthey all knew that in those days. Now the kids are probably aged out, they don't\nknow it anymore, but for a brief period. - You're behind the Windows activation. - You say it like it's a bad thing. - Everything's a matter of\nperspective. So tell the story of that. What's Windows\nactivation? How'd you get involved? - So they came to me late in the XP ship\nprocess. I don't know if the beta had gone out. I don't think the beta had gone out yet,\nbut they had intended to take the Office activation code and then adapt it\nto Windows and add activation to Windows. But whoever was responsible\nfor doing it had slipped it enough times that it wasn't going to happen. So I\nhad a reputation for being able to fix things quickly, so they came to me and said,\n\"Can you get this done in time for XP?\" \"I don't know, but I'll try.\"\nSo with the help of the guys that were doing the DRM stuff on the DRM side\nand the research guys doing the math for the product keys and everything else,\nwe cranked it out in time for XP. And I don't know what\nits actual impact is for revenue, but I imagine it's substantial\nwhen you start enforcing license keys. - I wonder what it is. - I don't know. - Because it's also annoying. - It is, especially if you have to phone activate. And\nthat was just the case that we had to carry with us as an albatross around our\nneck, where you've got to pass data up to the clearinghouse, the\nbackend systems that are going to approve your key. You've got to tell it all your hardware\nparameters, like how much memory and hard drive space and the various things the hardware\nkey is bound to, as well as the product key, and you've got it encoded in letters and\nnumbers that somebody's willing to read in over a phone. And if you think doing product\nactivation is painful over the phone, could you imagine being the person that\nworked on the other end of that line? I mean, that's just got to be a mind-numbing job\nto listen to product keys for eight hours a day. - Yeah, one of the challenges with\nWindows, and it's been a frustration point for me, but I\nunderstand from a design perspective, it's very\ndifficult, is so many different kinds of people\nuse Windows. But it's been frustrating how over time Windows\nhas more and more leaned into the direction of like the not-not the power user, I\nshould say, which is why sort of Linux has always been really\nwonderful. But from an activation perspective or from any kind\nof configuration, it's been a, it's been a source of a lot of frustration. - Yeah, one of my more popular episodes of\nlate has been why you can't move the Windows taskbar. - Yeah. - And I had no idea, but the outrage\nis palpable amongst people that you- - Yes. - ...just put it on the left or top, and you\ncan't anymore, and it is an affront to their existence. And I understand\nit to a certain extent. - Well, it's one of the main reasons I really just\ndislike Windows. There's a lot of aspects about Windows 11 I dislike, one of which is\nlike you can't customize things as much about the position of the\ntaskbar, just basic customization. Can we just configure stuff? Because\nthere's going to be a small contingent of power users that are just\ngoing to enjoy the hell out of this operating system if you just\ngive them that option. It costs you nothing. Just give them that freedom. - Well, it does cost, right? Because the\nfreedom to put the Start menu on the left or the top or the right really increases the complexity of the code that\nrenders the Start menu and lays out the tabs and does all the things, and now it's a\nmuch larger surface for bugs and it's a much larger piece of code to maintain, so\nyou probably need more developers or another developer or some portion of\na developer's time. So the question becomes at what point is it still\nworth it to satisfy the niche needs of a small set of users...And just, those decisions weren't mine to make.\nBut I could see it from both sides. - I think just like the\npeople who make movies and insert very nuanced details that only a small number of people will\nrealize are there, that's going to really pay off. There's a kind of\nreputation that builds over time that has a very powerful ripple effect.\nThat I think— it has so many benefits, including for hiring great\nsoftware engineers. It's like you create this aura of a place that puts love into every detail, that really\ntakes care of the power users, that takes care of the developers, and I\nthink Microsoft has more and more moved in that direction with GitHub and acquiring\nGitHub and just taking care of the developers. But on the\nWindows interface side, come on, some customization.\nWith VS Code, you can customize everything. Why can't we customize\nthe Start menu, all right? Anyway, and the taskbar. And really every\naspect of the Windows interface. I don't— I—maybe you're right. Maybe it\nincreases the complexity of the code. I suspect that's just not the case. - I bet it was. I bet it was a scheduling decision when\nthey rewrote the Start menu. I think they rewrote it because it's different\nthan the old taskbar. And somebody was tasked with, \"You've got to\ndeliver this set of functionality, and if I cut out putting it on the left and the top and the\nright and two rows of tabs and all the other cool features, I can deliver it four\nmonths sooner.\" And I'm not saying that's the right decision, but I'm guessing that\nmight be the kind of thing that motivates it. And they're on such a different\nrelease schedule now. It used to be... You won't see much craftsmanship\nunless somebody owns a component for a long time and it settles to a point that\nthen you can work on and polish it, right? But if it's always churning and the\nUI is changing every release, it's never going to get that level of polish.\nAlthough I think the UI is pretty nice, but... - Yeah, it is nice, but I think\nit's— I just don't think it's a scheduling thing. I think it's a craftsmanship\nthing. Just like you with the Task Manager, if there's a guy or a girl in there who takes ownership of it, who has a\npassionate—like for them, it's a thing that they take pride in\nover a period of time, they can by themselves in a short amount of\ntime create something truly wonderful. - Right. - And I think if you have large\nsoftware engineering teams with managers and scheduling of meetings\nand all this kind of stuff, yeah, okay. Then your\nargument applies. But if you allow the flourishing of\nindividuals that create cool stuff and like their own side project,\nwhich Google is very good at. - They've tried that at Google, yeah. - Yeah, like have fun with it. Do\nsome crazy stuff and then we'll integrate it. We'll try to integrate\nit into the whole ecosystem. I don't know. I don't know, because to me, there's\nsuch a great joy for an individual developer to create something like\ncustomization of the Start menu or the taskbar because you know that\nmillions of people are going to use it, the taskbar. And then you know that thousands, tens of thousands of developers\nmight be using to customize even little subtle aspects of the taskbar.\nYou know how much joy you create, you give to people to customize— to\nhave some kind of JSON thing where you customize something about the taskbar? - Okay, but how do you respond\nto the Steve Jobs aspect of giving you customization implies that we\ncouldn't figure out the right answer for you? Or maybe there is no right answer and all four\nanswers are equally right. I have no idea, but... - Right. I think I've always-- I'm glad\nApple exists. It's a beautiful thing and that idea of design is wonderful, but I\nalways thought that Windows creates the contrast. The point of Windows is to be the operating system that works on all\nkinds of devices, that just as much, it's supposed to be much more open. And they've\nmoved towards that direction more and more with Windows Subsystem for Linux.\nIt's just this whole developer- friendly ecosystem. The interface should\nbe in the spirit of that, I think. - Right. - But I do think that there could also be\nsecurity vulnerabilities created with that. It's not just the complexity of\nthe code, because Windows is just under attack. It's very difficult to keep it\nsecure. Anyway, taking that tangent, you also developed a ZIP file support for Windows, creating Visual ZIP.\nLike I mentioned, ZIP folders that eventually evolved into ZIP\nfolders. Tell the story of that. - So that was a piece of software that I wrote\nat home again, and what happened was I was out with my wife and I think it was a Sunday\nafternoon. We're driving around. This is 1993, and we're living in our apartment and we're just\nseeing what the housing market is like out there. And there's a guy, he's got this\nbeautiful three-bedroom house and a Corvette convertible, '93 red, torch red,\nparked in the driveway and house is for sale, and it's like 300K, I think, and there's\nno chance I'm coming up with 300K at that point, or even the down\npayment on that. So I took the flyer and I cut the picture\nof the house out and I taped it to my monitor. And that was my incentive to just\nwrite something at night because when I came home, I was doing two things.\nI was, one, expressing a creativity that I couldn't get out at work\nwhen I was just fixing bugs, and I was trying to make some extra money. And\nso I wrote a Shell extension. Before I actually went to the Shell team I started it, and\nthat's what led to my interest in going to the Shell team based on an MSDN sample or\nMSJ at the time, MSJ sample that I saw on how to like bring up\na folder. Well, once I had the very basic bring up a folder template, adding ZIP\nfile support to it was just incremental all the way. And I released it as a\nshareware product. I think it was 19.95 or 29.95 and I sold whatever, couple\nhundreds or thousands of copies, and one day I'm getting ready for work and I\nget a call and it's a lady and she says, \"Are you Dave Plummer?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" She said,\n\"Are you the guy that wrote Visual ZIP?\" I said, \"Yeah.\" And she said, \"Well, this is Betsy\nfrom Microsoft and we'd like you to come by and come in and talk about an acquisition\nof it. And I said, \"Okay, what building are you in?\" And she's like, \"What do you\nmean?\" And I said, \"Well, I'll come by.\" And she said, \"Well, no, you got to talk to travel and you got to\ntalk to legal, and this all has to be set up.\" And I'm like, \"I don't get it. We both work at the same place.\nWhy can't I just stop by?\" I don't know if I said that literally- ...but it was a few minutes of back and forth where\nwe both realized that she didn't know I worked there. - Yeah, that's funny. - They had just cold-called the author\nand then found out that it was me. - Yeah. That's funny. - And so they made me an offer on it, and it's the kind\nof thing where if I don't accept the offer, well, now my choices are I can keep selling my\nown version and quit Microsoft, or I can stop selling my own version and work\nfor Microsoft. Neither of those is great. I mean, I'd like to keep my\njob of course, but I'd like to still- ...have this income stream. And the other option\nwas to accept their offer, which is what I did. So then I bought a used\n'93 red Corvette and... - And you got to continue\nbuilding it internally? - I did. So we took a lot of features out,\nright, to simplify, because it had encryption and it had a number of features that\nwere common in ZIP programs of the day, but probably weren't appropriate\nfor Windows. And, at the time, encryption was like a\nmunition, so you couldn't just add encryption willy-nilly to various parts of the\noperating system, so we took out some things like that. Multi-volume support, I think,\nwas taken out just to simplify it. - Can you speak to ZIP in general, just\nthe history of ZIP and, you know, compression, that whole thing? - Yeah, it was really borne out of the BBS era\nwhen people were dialing in on modems to download trialware and shareware\nand other things from BBSs online and to compress them.\nExecutables compressed about half their size. Other stuff\ncompresses much more. But a guy named Phil Katz came up with a command line\nprogram for MS-DOS called PKZIP, which was able to do compression\nof programs, and he has a rather tragic arc. But it became\nubiquitous in the entire PC industry, and pretty much everybody\nwas using it. So when Windows came out, there was no way to open up a ZIP\nfile, but everybody had been creating them for a decade, and so that really drove\nthe desire to have the ZIP support right at Windows. - Yeah, and that's another piece of software\nthat's just kind of with us to this day. - Mm-hmm. And it could be vastly improved, but, you know,\nit was written in the single core days, so it doesn't do anything multi-threaded.\nAnd you've got a 96-core 7995, well, it uses one of\nthem to unzip your file. - What other awesome things were\nyou a part of at Microsoft? What other pieces of software? - I worked on the initial prototypes\nof Windows Media Center. So we did ... that in '96, I believe. And we didn't have, at the time, any\nsources, so we had like a CD of MPEG video files of Raging Rudolph and\nI think the original South Park video, ... the Christmas one. Which is all wildly\ninappropriate in the workplace today, ...it's all the content we had until we got actually...\nWe had them put a satellite dish on the roof, DSS, whatever the 18-inch dish is, because\nwe couldn't get cable to the building. And so we built up this thing that would eventually\nlook a lot like Media Center, and it was distance viewing UI for Windows, so you could\nsit with a remote control on a desktop and have, you know... The current Start\nmenu is not great at 20 feet away, so. - Tell me the story of the\ninfamous blue screen of death. - What it is is when Windows has no other\noption, when the kernel gets into a state where something illegal has happened,\nso let's say a device driver is trying to write to a piece of memory it doesn't own or\nis trying to free a piece of memory twice, of memory twice, something that just cannot happen,\nand the kernel has no other option. It will shut the machine down to save your work. And... Well, not save, but prevent\nfurther damage, and it puts up a blue screen and it prints out the stack\ninformation, depending on your settings. Sometimes it's just a sad\nface... ...In the current Windows. - Yeah, I wonder what the first version of\nWindows was when the blue screen came to be. - So, Windows 3 had a blue screen... ...but it's completely unrelated to the blue\nscreen in Windows NT. And I talked to the guy who wrote the blue screen in Windows\nNT. His name's Jon Viert. And, the reason he picked white\non blue, I had thought. I'd always heard it was because in the labs, you could\nwalk through a lab where we have 50 PCs all running stressed. \"Oh, that one's\ngot a blue screen. It's-\" ...crashed.\" It wasn't that simple. It was\njust the MIPS firmware that he was building it on was blue on white, and Visual\nSlickEdit that he was using as an editor was also the same color scheme.\nAnd so you could code, boot, crash, and reboot, all in\nthe same color scheme. - Why do you think so many\nproblems with computers can be solved by turning it off and\nturning it on back again? - I think there's two major things that happen\nwith computers as you run them over time. One is memory gets used and not freed. And so it accumulates on the heap or in\nthe swap file or wherever, and things get sluggish. And the other is, code gets\ninto a state that the developers didn't anticipate or didn't test very well. And maybe that's a rare state, but now that\nNotepad or Word or Excel is in that state, your system is goofy. So if you just reboot the thing\nor shut it down or restart it, you're getting a fresh state and there's no memory leaks,\nso it covers a lot of sins, basically. - and the intricate ways that several pieces of software in a\ngoofy state interact with each other creates sort of a meta\ngoofy state that just kind of just the entire system\nstarts acting a little weird. And then somehow fixes it. What's some of\nthe best and the worst code you've seen during that time at Microsoft? What's\nsome beautiful code and what's some ugly code that pops to memory? - In terms of beautiful code, there's\ntwo that stand out for me. One is the kernel in general. When you get\ndown into the Windows kernel... ...in the actual NT APIs and stuff,\nit's very well written, and it's written to a standard that you don't see on\nthe user side, or at least is uncommon on the user side. On the user side,\nprobably the coolest code I remember seeing was a guy named Bob\nDay who wrote a named pipe implementation to eliminate the use of\nshared memory. So Windows 95 had a big shared segment amongst all the shell processes where\nit would store stuff that was common to all the shells. We didn't want to do\nthat. Shared memory is a bad idea on NT and at an industrial level, so he\ncame up with a way to do it with named pipes, and I remember doing\na code review on it, and it was very impressive to walk\nthrough the code. It was one of those things where it was like, \"Oh, I don't\nthink I could have done that if I was trying.\" - Who's the greatest programmer\nyou've ever encountered? - You know what? I don't think there is any\none. I've met a number of great programmers. But I'll tell you one story that impressed me a lot.\nWhen I was brand new at the company, I'd been there like six weeks, and I'm working on this\nOLE Presentation Cache that I'd mentioned earlier. And I'm on Windows\n95, and I've got Excel inserted into Word, and I'm in the kernel\ndebugger, and something's going wrong in the scheduler. And I've been there, you\nknow, I've barely written any x86 code, and I'm looking at the Windows scheduler,\ntrying to figure out why my thing is deadlocked. And eventually, I get\nstuck, so I'm kind of out of my element, and I send an email to the Windows 95\nkernel team, and say, \"Could you send somebody by?\" And so about 10 minutes later,\nthis developer strolls in, and they're just holding a null modem cable, which is to connect\nmy two machines together so they can debug one with the other in case I didn't have it, but it\nwas already set up. And so they sit down, and they're using WinDbg, which is a\nhorrible debugger. It's just, it's accursed. But they're very, very competent\nwith it, and they are just blasting through the call stacks, and they're\nchecking all these objects in the kernel, and trying to find out who's waiting on\nwhat and why things are deadlocked, and what things are signaled and what's not. And\nit's just this quicksilver ballet of call stacks flying by, and I'm watching\nthis, and I'm pretty blown away because I'm a good programmer, but this person is an amazing\ndebugger, and I've never seen a performance like this. And about five minutes\nin, I just hear, \"Oh, I see.\" And then they disconnected and\ngot up and left. And that was Laura Butler, who became a distinguished engineer at Microsoft.\nI think she may still be. I'm not sure if she's retired or not, but... So\nshe kind of set my template for, you know, what Microsoft developers\nwere like when they're debugging, and what kernel developers were like, and even what female\ndevelopers were like, because I had such a small sample set. But it was a very\nhigh standard, so... - There are few things I love in life more\nthan people who are ultra-competent at anything, really. But the lower\nlevel, the better, in the engineering space. They're able to, for\nexample, run or maintain the infrastructure, the computer infrastructure.\nSo not the individual computer, but the computers communicating together\nand working together. Those people are just magicians. It's so inspiring. It's\nlike watching a great carpenter or... - I love anything done really, really well. - Yeah, it's beautiful to see. It's beautiful to\nsee that humans are able to accomplish that. Even in civil engineering space,\nwhen I look at, like, bridges, it's like, the number of people that had to\ncome together to build that, and now millions of people use it every single day.\nWith software, sometimes you don't get to see visually just the\nnumber of people impacted by a thing. So imagine how many\npeople are impacted by Linux, and all the different\nopen-source systems that make up Linux. It's incredible. And Task Manager is\nan example of a piece of software, just how many people have used\nthat over the years, and how many times? It's crazy. It's probably, is\nit billions? Billions have used that. - Yeah, two billion a month or something. - Two billion? - Something like that. I've seen\nthe metrics and it's up there. - Oh. Crazy to you? - It is. What I love about it, though,\nand I'm sure you've had this experience where sometimes you design a piece of software and\nit's complex and you get it working in your head, and you get the plumbing working, and you know how it's\ngonna run and flow, and then eventually you write the code, and the code does that thing that\nyou had pictured in your head. And now there are billions of copies of that thing\nthat I had in my head running on millions of people, or billions of peoples\nand machines, and that in itself is really cool to me. It's not a\nvanity thing so much as, I'm impressed by it, I guess. - How has your programming\nevolved over the years? - I take a lot more care with\ncomplexity these days. So, it used to be you would write code\nand just keep writing code, writing code, and then at some point, go back and clean\nit up. Well, I write the other way now. I try to write really clean initial skeletal\ncode and then flesh it out because I have been involved in too many projects of\nmy own and of other people's making, where things get so messed\nup that they're just not fixable. And so sometimes the work you\nput in upfront pays off, you know? - What programming languages have you used over\nthe years? What's been your main go-tos? - For me, it's been C++\nand assembly language. - And still to this day, C++\nis really what you lean on? - Yeah, right now I'm 100% Lua and Python,\nbut that's just a side project I'm working on, so... - Can you speak to the Lua and the Python detour that you took, and\nwhat do you love about C++? - What I'm doing is, I wanted to build an AI\nto play the game Tempest. That's the old Atari game, Tempest. And this is a game\nthat I actually hold the world record on. And, uh- - Can you take me to this Atari\ngame, Tempest? Okay, Atari Tempest. What kind of game is this? - So, it's a 3D vector game from 1980. - Okay. - And it's a very complex game. You've got full 360\ndegrees of motion, you have eight shots on the screen. There's like 11 enemies, there's spikes.\nSo, it's a very complex game. It's not like trying to, you know,\ndo Pong or something. - Okay. - And what I wound up doing was first taking\nthe ROMs out of the machine and reverse engineering the code. So, I got a\nsense of where all the code in Tempest lives and what it does, where the zero\npage variables are, where things live. And yeah, there's one. - So what? Oh, wow. That's a\nvery geometric. Okay, what? Can you explain to me the gameplay? - Yeah, that's me playing\nthe game right there. - This is literally you playing? - This is me. Dave is the high score,\nyou'll see in the top center there. - Can you explain to me what I'm looking at? - Well, it's a 3D geometric world.\nIt's basically 3D Space Invaders wrapped into a shape, and\nthe enemies descend from the center of the tube towards the outside,\nand they all have different behaviors and... - Wow. - So, long story short, it's a fairly\ncomplicated game to play well. And I wanted to see if I could get an AI to\ndo it. So, once I had figured out where all the interesting parts of the game lived\nin memory, I added them as parameters and built a Lua app to extract everything\nfrom the game's memory as it's running, and puts them together as parameters, which\nsends it to the Python side over a socket, and then the Python side does RL learning.\nI'm using a dueling Deep-Q, and I believe— ...two with two head and tail,\nand they chase each other and it can play up to about level 36\nnow, which is way better than most humans. But that's level 96, so\nit's got a ways to go yet, but— - And you're the red thing shooting? - Yes. - You're controlling the red thing that's shooting?\nOkay. What are the options? You can just move clockwise or counterclockwise\nand then you could shoot. - Yeah, so you have a rotating knob— ...which is an optical spinner, and you have a\nfire button and a super zapper for emergencies. But that's it. Fire and rotate, basically. - Alright, let's get back to your favorite C++. What\ndo you love about C++? Why have you stayed with it for all these years? - Because it allows me to encapsulate my\nfavorite C code in classes. I'm not a big— - You're really a C guy. - Well, I actually— - Okay, I gotcha. - Yeah, I'm really a C guy. Although, I write\ntwo kinds of C++. I write really modern C++ 20 using no pointers, no string,\nor no character strings, so there are, you know, it's basically as safe\nas Rust as far as I'm concerned. Or I write C with classes, which\nis standard C, but, you know, with polymorphism and encapsulation\nand... That's most of what my code is. But I try to do both. - Let me ask you about the whole stretch of time\nthat we kind of skipped over. You built a lot of software over the years after\nMicrosoft, on the side while at Microsoft and afterwards, a lot of successful pieces of software. One of your\ncompanies was Software Online. And it got into trouble for\nnagging users too much, I guess— ...to upgrade. That's what I saw.\nWhat was all that about and what did you learn from that experience? - That was... Other than, like, family health scares,\nyou know, when kids are sick, that was the scariest time of my life. And the period leading up\nto it was one of the most invigorating and exciting, because what had happened was,\nwhile I was at Microsoft, I had written all these shareware utilities and I was selling\nthem on the side and sold one to Microsoft, as we talked about, and they started to do\nreally well. And then I discovered banner advertising online. And so I signed up with my\ncredit card for a site. I think it was called Fast Click, and you could say, \"I\nwill pay this much for a banner ad impression. Here's my banner.\" And it\nwould rotate it in. And I didn't set a cap on it. I came back on Monday\nand I saw I had spent like $10,000 in banner ads. I was like,\n\"Holy crap. How am I going to explain this to my wife? This is a\nbug, it's a mistake, it was my fault.\" And I looked at the sales and it had\nmade like $38,000 worth of sales. And I was like, \"Holy cow. So all\nI have to do is scale that at some point,\" and basically did\nthat for the next several years. And the reason we got\nin trouble was the AG came in and they had, well, I was blown away\nbecause they had like 12 court claims of action and 10 of them were\noutrageous, which to me as a person with autism, I couldn't get past. It's like,\nI know these 10 things are absolutely not true. Why are we even here talking about them?\nAnd then all they care are the two things that might be true. And the two things that might\nbe true were that it was a 30-day trial version and after your 30 days were up, it would\nthen, if you continued to run it and not buy it or uninstall it, it would remind you once a\nday. Not like every 10 minutes, but once a day or every time you booted your\ncomputer, but most once a day. And the AG contended that was too often,\nit amounted to spam. And so we agreed with them to limit it\nto once a week, I believe. And, you know, there had to be a button to just\nuninstall with one click. So we did those kinds of things. The other one was, in those\ndays when somebody bought a piece of software, even if they bought it online and got\na download, they fully expected there would be media showing up at their house.\nSo in the year 2001, which we're 2001-2003 we're talking about,\nif you bought software, there was an expectation that a disc would show\nup. And so we made that the default, was to fulfill by disc and it was $3.95 or $4.95\nextra and it was very obvious, but it was a checkbox and it was turned on to ship\nthe disc to your house. Because we found if we didn't do that, we got all these calls,\npeople would wait, they'd order. Two weeks later call, \"Where's my disc?\" And we'd look, \"Oh,\nyou didn't order a disc.\" \"Well, cancel it all. I don't want it because I'm not waiting for it.\" And\nso we got a lot of returns and we didn't include the disc and so we decided to include the\ndisc, but that is a, a priori violation of negative affirmation billing in\nWashington State because you're giving them a default higher purchase price. - What about on the software user relationship? It's interesting\nlike how often to annoy the user with a thing. Right? If you never mention\nanything, they might never discover something they actually want. But if you mention it too much,\nthen they can get annoyed. - Yeah. And what you don't want is you don't want\nthem to have to do it or buy it or do something to get rid of it. - That's one of the things that bothers\nme with Windows. I think it does that a little bit still\nto this day, where it bothers me by asking me certain\nquestions, like, \"Do you want this?\" For example, I really don't like to use\nmy Microsoft account to log into Windows. - Right. - I think now it's like basically\nrequired. I think there's just no way around it. But, like, they make it so difficult to not do that.\nIt's almost like they think they can just trick\nme into... It really does feel like I'm getting tricked\ninto not doing what I want to do. - Right. - Like, I have to think, \"Okay,\nI need to click skip,\" and then it'll do something, \"Are you\nsure?\" Like, I have to use too much of my brain to do the thing I... Like,\nyou know, as an interface, as an interface, you know what I'm trying\nto do. You're trying to trick me into not doing the thing I want\nto do, and what I hate about that is, like... It's probably effective,\nsure, for converting people, but it's really not good long-term for taking\ncare of the interests of the user. - Yeah, the one that really throws me\nis the user-recommended settings. So I just did a Windows upgrade, I went through the\nsteps, and I'm going through this new dialog or wizard. Use recommended settings sounds like the thing\nyou should do, but I'm pretty sure that resets you to using the Edge browser and... - Right. - and all this other stuff. So yeah, recommended\nby them, but not recommended for me. And that's the difficulty. - That's a really good example.\nWhat effect do you think that does in resetting the\ndefault browser to Edge? Do you think you're going to really earn the\nloyalty of a user if you do that? Don't you think that there are actually...\nWhat you're going to create... You're going to create some passive loyalty from some user base, so on\nthe metrics, it might actually look like you've increased the number of\nEdge users, but really, it's that reputation hit you take\nover time where it just forms where Edge is the thing\nthat you can't quite trust. - Right. - Unfairly, because I think Edge is a\nreally great browser, but just this unpleasant feeling. I don't\nknow what that is and... - Well, you don't want your operating\nsystem to be an adversary, right? And sometimes Windows can feel adversarial.\nLike, it doesn't have your best interests at heart, and that bugs me\nto a certain extent. - I mean, we have this feeling, I think we\njust have general distrust when somebody is super nice to you and is basically\nselling something. There's a certain aura about that kind of interaction. And when an operating system is interacting\nwith you in that way, it's like... - Yeah, I would much rather pay $199\nfor Windows Pro per year, or 20 bucks a month or whatever the fee schedule would be\nand not be upsold any further and not have my data monetized and those\nkinds of things, so... - Did you learn about finding\nthe right balance from that? - Yeah, I mean, I'm way more self-aware now.\nThere are things I would do much differently and particularly in terms of the advertising.\nI always figured... There's a guy named David Ogilvy, and he did this ad long ago for\nthe Volkswagen Beetle, where it had a picture of a Beetle, black and white, and it just\nsaid, \"Lemon,\" and there was a block of text below it. So it's clickbait-y\nand then informational, and I always tried to follow that pattern, but\nthere's three ways to sell something, I think, and you can use sex, fear, or greed,\nand sex doesn't work really well for software. Fear works well for\nantivirus and stuff, but not so much for optimization and make your\ncomputer faster utilities. And so I always tried to\ncater to the greed aspect. you know, make your computer faster, get more\nRAM available, whatever the value proposition is. But I realize now that\nI'm looking at that with my knowledge, and as an autistic person, I now\nhave an appreciation that other people are gonna look at it with their background\nknowledge and may conclude something different. So I might be scaring people where I was just\ntrying to incentivize or get their greed instinct going. So I'd be more sensitive\nabout that kind of thing today. - Ridiculous question, but\nwhat do you think is the top three Windows operating\nsystems, the different versions? - I'm a fan of Windows 2000 Server. That's - Wait, what? Really? - Yeah. - Okay. Wait, please. - That's what I ran my business on, and I ran my\nbrother's business. We set up multiple salons all VPNed to one another and\nusing the SQL Server and... - I don't know if I ever got to experience\nWindows 2000 server, so when was XP out? - 2001. - What was before XP? - 2000. - 2000. Was that good? - Yeah, I liked it. It doesn't have the visual\nflash that came with XP, but as a system, and especially as a server operating\nsystem, it was great for the day. - But then XP was, hmm, I would say probably from a completeness perspective and impact\nand how long it lasted, it was probably the greatest Windows for\nconsumers, the operating system. - I would think so. It's certainly\ngot the longevity for it. There's people who still run it. I mean, I'd still run it\non stuff if you could get security updates, because it does 98% of what I need Windows to do, but... - Yeah, that was incredible. I mean,\nso Windows 95, I'll probably put Windows XP as the number one for\nme, and then Windows 95 two. - What's your metric? Personal\npreference or industry impact or... - Industry impact, stability, just there's certain, like, just like with\nprogramming, you have code smell. Just, like, how well all the features were\norchestrated together, how there's a design philosophy that permeated\nthe whole thing and was consistent. Not too many features,\nnot dumbed down too much. - Right. - but not overcomplicated. How often it\ncrashes to blue screen. All of those things. - I don't know if it's a very apt description, but I\nthink of it as crisp. So there's not a lot of rough edges. It does what it\ndoes, does it snappy and... - Yeah. You said you play slot machines and given that you love\nhardware and software, you're the perfect person to ask\nhow do slot machines work? - Well, I'm happy to ruin them for you. - Okay. - So- It's ironic to me that I play slot\nmachines, cause I know it's a losing bet overall, but there's a whole dopamine feast\nthere of bright lights and high contrast colors that I enjoy. So I do play them.\nBut what happens is, internally, there's basically a black box mechanism that\ndoes nothing more than generate the next random number and what the\noutcome is in terms of probability and payout. And then the game says, \"I\ngotta make up a movie to go along with that.\" And maybe it's three bars or whatever it is,\nbut there's no correlation. It's not spinning the reels, seeing where they land, and looking\nthat up to see what you won. It's completely the other direction. It determines whether or\nnot or if you won and then makes something up to fit that scenario. - That indeed is ruining it for everyone. - A little bit. - What kind of code runs them? - I don't really know. I tried to\nget down and get inside access to one, and it was very hard. They don't\nwant to tell you a lot about them, that deep of a secret, but... - Yeah. - They're all basic Windows PCs, but\nthey're basic Windows PCs on top of a very secure enclave of some\nkind that I don't know a lot about. - Yeah, it has to be\nextremely secure, right? - Yeah. Well, in the '70s or '80s, there was\na tech in Vegas who went around and he was burning his own ROMs\nfor the slot machines, with a backdoor in them, and so when he serviced\nthe machine, he would just put his ROM in, - Nice. - and he'd come back six months later and... - Nice. - invoke the backdoor and... - I love humans so much. Anyway,\ndo you have other favorite kinds of systems like that? - I like a lot of old hardware. I\nrestore cars, so I do a lot of 1960s muscle cars, cars and trucks. - Nice. - And old computers, so I restore PDP-11s.\nIt's been my fascination and my special interest for the last six months\nor so, and I've built a number of those. - Yeah, I've seen you posting\nvideos about it, the PDP-11/83. What's that whole project? - So basically, what it is, is I had built\na number of PDP-11s. And so over the years, I had acquired all these parts and I decided, \"Well, let me build\nthe best PDP-11 that I can.\" And so it was kind of a quest to,\njust like you try to max out a PC, I tried to max out a PDP-11. So it's got four\nmegabytes of memory, which would be massive in the day. And yeah, that's it there. And it's got lots of blinking lights, and I had to\nrewrite the BSD kernel to make the lights work and... - What are we looking at\nhere? What is, what's... - So the very top is a PDP-11/70\ncontrol panel, which we can largely ignore, and then there's two\nchassis below that. One has- - What are the different knobs?\nSorry to ask dumb questions here. - The knobs, they, uh- ...control\nwhat view you get of the LEDs. - Oh. - So normally, you see the data bus and\nyou can see the address bus. And you can pause the machine, you can edit the address on\nthe bus, and you can deposit stuff into memory with the switches. - Man, the haptic plus the LEDs. That's\nwhat you like, imagine a computer to be. - Yeah. - That's so cool. That's so cool. And then\nthese are what? What are these? These are DU1, DU2? - Yeah. It's a weird floppy drive. It's a\ndual floppy drive with one stepper motor. So both heads seek together\nlike Siamese twins. - Okay. What kind of stuff are you\ndoing with this? What are you- ... are you trying to restore them? - Yeah, so I restore them and- - Does it actually run? - Yeah. - Oh, all the blinking lights are real? - Yeah, it's all real. - Wow. - Then I had to rebuild the kernel and all that, so I had\nto learn the BSD kernel. I'm pretty familiar with it now to get... Cause you can't just add a device driver, right?\nYou've got to rebuild the kernel to add support for whatever device. So you\nadd a new disk controller. It's time to build the kernel, so you gotta\ngo find the source and find the code and... - And you can run code on this? - Yeah. - You've written a couple books on\nautism. Being autistic yourself, I was wondering if you could tell me about, like, fundamental\ndifferences about the mind of a person with autism versus, let's say,\na neurotypical individual. - Well, the fundamental theory of thought\nfor autism is called monotropism. And basically what that means is that my\nbrain does one thing and does it very intensely, and then when it's done I can\nmove on and do something else. But I'm not a multitasker. I'm a serial\nsingle-tasker by any stretch. Um, autism usually brings with\nit sensory sensitivities and repetitive behaviors,\nbehavioral issues that compound it. And if they rise to the level\nwhere an individual can't moderate or accommodate them in their life, it becomes\na disorder. And that's probably one to two percent of the population. - What's the biggest benefit\nof life with autism? - Um, I can bring to bear an incredible\namount of focus and dedication on a particular task. And it has\nto be something I love, it has to be something that's rewarding, it has to be something\nI can make progress on, and there has to be all these things that are true about it. And it\ncould be like a kid playing with trains. I get that same feeling. - That said, you also said\nthat you struggle with ADHD. - Yeah, a fair bit. - So that's part of the component,\nlike, maintaining the focus? - Or actually, acquiring the focus\nis the issue. I'm very easily distracted. I fall asleep with noise-canceling\nheadphones, or I can't fall asleep, that kind of thing. But once I get locked\nin, I'm very hard to distract. So it's kind of a paradox. - Oh, that's fascinating. - It's hard to get into that state. - Okay. What's the biggest challenge\nof life with an autistic mind? - That I don't know what anybody else is\nthinking. So I know what I would think about this interaction if I was\nin your position and I was you. And that's the best I can do. But I think most\nneurotypical people have a sense of, \"Well, Lex probably feels this way or that way 'cause he's\nacting this way and his reactions are this and his facial expressions say this and...\" That's all\nkind of lost on me. So I run a little proxy NPC game for everybody I deal with. - So I guess that makes social\ninteraction a little bit complicated. - It can be, yeah. Telephone is especially\nhard because I rely on a lot of other cues, and when somebody is just on the phone\nand I just have their voice, there's so much that's implied between people that I miss. So I'm much better\non FaceTime, where if somebody makes a joke, they might smile after that. On the phone, I don't know if you're being\nsarcastic or serious and that kind of thing, so... - So that's probably gotten you into\ntrouble over the years a bit. - Yeah. There's lots of times with\nmy wife, too, where... There's a certain literalism\nthat comes with autism. And we spent years where she would say something, and I'd say,\n\"But that doesn't make sense.\" She'll say, \"You know what I mean.\" I'm like, \"No, I know what\nyou said, and I'm not being just combative here. I literally only know\nwhat you said.\" and I don't have that. I remember we've been\nin meetings with people and, you know, if there's three or four people in\nthe meeting and I'm the only autistic person, I'll tell that they've got this communication\nloop going on, and I have to, like... You got to tell me what's going on 'cause\nI really don't know what's being said here, so... - You told me, related to this, that\nthere was an early, somewhat awkward encounter with Bill\nGates. Can you share this story of that interaction and\nhow autism comes into play here? - Yeah. My very first summer at Microsoft\nwhen I got the internship, Bill had all the interns over. I guess it\nwas 20 or maybe 25 of us, that got hired that year, over to his\nhouse for burgers and beers and just chat in the backyard. Of course,\nit's still Bill Gates, and he's a big enough deal even then that\nyou're a little nervous. So my manager, Ben, who was sort\nof my mentor at the time, took me over to introduce me to Bill 'cause\nhe knew him. He's explaining, \"This is Dave. He's our intern from Canada. In the space of\nfour months, he's done this feature and just copy and smart drive,\" and he listed off all the\nstuff I was doing. But I stopped because I'm like, \"Well, actually, it was\nthree months.\" And I had to interrupt them, and they both kind of, \"What?\" And\nthey looked at each other, and I realized that was the wrong time to- to\ncorrect a guy. But... - Yeah. So for you, little inaccuracies? - Oh, drive me crazy. - And then you, of course\nyou don't... The impact that might have on a\ncasual social interaction, it's not trivial for you\nto be aware of that. - Yeah. I'm much better than I used to be.\nBefore, I didn't know and I didn't know how injecting a correction\nmeaninglessly into a conversation could impact or make the other person feel.\nNow I got a better sense of it, but... - What advice would you have for\nfolks who have an autistic mind on how to flourish in this world? - In terms of prosperity and finances,\nthe biggest thing I can say is sell what you can do, and not yourself. Because\nif you go into a job interview and you try to wow them with your personality and how\namazing you are, it may or may not go well. But if you go in with your portfolio of work and say,\n\"Look, here's my GitHub history and here are the awesome projects I contributed to, and here's\nthe actual algorithm I wrote, and this is what I do,\" I think you get a lot further\nwith that. Whether you're playing the piano or writing code. - That said, so much of\nsoftware engineering on large teams has a social\ncomponent to it, right? - It does, and that was a liability for me. - How do you... I mean, what have you learned\nabout how to solve that little puzzle? - I think the biggest deficit for me\nwas when I started to manage people, because now you're concerned about their hopes, dreams,\naspirations, what motivates them. They have entire lives that are kind of a mystery to me,\nbecause I assume they want to be motivated and led and encouraged and\ncompensated exactly as I would. And that's not always the case. Some people need a lot more\naffirmation, some people just want money, some people want to be in the important meetings and make\ndecisions. But I was largely oblivious to that. And so eventually, I had to learn\nthat everybody that you're managing has their own set of incentives and priorities,\nand they're completely different from what I think they probably are. - So you could, I guess, make things\nmore explicit and just communicate better about, like... ask them\nabout what their interests are. - Yeah. And that's something I started doing,\nis overtly asking. Because it's hard for me to nudge somebody there. I'm not\ngood with that kind of social dance, so... - Yeah, part of the social dance is\nthere's a lot of stuff that's unsaid. You can kind of figure out... You can read\npeople. But if that's... With autism, it might be a little bit difficult to do\nthat, and so you have to make things more explicit. Plus, like, sarcasm and\nsatire and humor might be difficult. I would love to be a fly on the wall in\nsome of your earlier interactions with Microsoft. I mean, some of the greatest\nengineers have a mind like this, so... - Yeah, I've had laptops thrown at me and stuff,\nand I'm sure it was my own fault, so... - You write about the 10-second autism\ntest. Could you explain how this works? - Yeah. Now, there is, of course... Anything that\nhas two answers has a high error rate, but... So what's more important to society as a\nwhole from the people? Is it cooperation or creativity? And if you had to\npick one, which is the most important? And most neurotypical\npeople will generally lean towards cooperation, whereas people on the\nspectrum tend to lean towards creativity as individual problem-solvers. - Of course, there's some\nkind of error rate there. - So if you want to double your precision, you\ncan use a second test: you ask, \"There's a room with 10 chairs, and six people come in\nand sit down in those chairs. How many chairs are left?\" Now, some\npeople are going to say four, but I'm going to say 10, because that's\nhow many chairs are still there. Literally true. And I'm not being a dick. - Yeah, okay. - I'm not trying to be complicated,\nbut that is how my mind works. And so when I see that question, it's\nlike it depends how you answer it. - So you're saying how\nliterally you take things? - Yeah, everything is very literal for\nme. I remember as a kid, my grandfather was building a planter holder in\nthe kitchen for my mom. And he was using these big angle brackets that I thought were a little\noverkill, and I said, \"Do you think that'll be big enough to hold the plant?\" And he says,\n\"It'll be big enough to hold a horse.\" And I was only five, but I was very confused\nabout, A, why you would bring a horse into your kitchen, why you would put a horse up on a planter, and\nall of these things that didn't make any sense to me when obviously it was a figure of speech. But\nfor a lot of my life, I took figures of speech as literal, so... - You've mentioned emotional\npost-processing as a strategy you use to replace social interactions\nso you can sort of reverse engineer to help you understand\nthe neurotypical world. Can... I think this is going to be useful\nto a lot of people. What does that entail? How does that help you? - So if I meet somebody, particularly somebody new, and it's\nmy first couple interactions with them, so even meeting you today, then I will go\nhome later and replay all of the moments where I had\nchoices to make. And probably the most uncomfortable ones\nfirst, to find out, what did I do wrong in that moment? What did I\nmiss? What was the other person thinking? How can I improve that kind of situation\nnext time, and do I need to go fix it or make a phone call, that kind of thing in a\nbad... you know, in an extreme case. But, And that's happened a couple\ntimes in my life. I had a car restored that my dad had bought new in\n'69. I still have it, so we've had it 50 years. And about 20 years ago,\nI had it restored, and it was a three-year process of craftsmen working on\nthis car for thousands of hours. And I go out to pick it up and I'm inspecting the car and I'm very impressed\nwith the work and I'm saying, \"Oh, this is nice and this is great,\" and everything\nelse. Then I fly home and write the check and the car gets delivered.\nThen I realized probably 10 years later that I had a whole bunch of\ncraftsmen that had worked on my car for three years, and I probably should have blown some smoke up\ntheir butts about what a great job they did, but I never did that because it's not what I wanted or needed\nin that moment. And I was completely oblivious to that. So I sent an email to the\nmanager or to the owner of the place, and I said, \"I don't know if you remember\nthis, but 10 years ago, I picked up my car and I probably looked unimpressed, but I want you to know that\nI was very impressed with everything and the quality and everything else.\" And he wrote back. He's\nlike, \"I've thought of that moment often.\" So I'm like, \"Now I'm\nglad I brought it up.\" - Yeah, there are subtle things about human\ninteraction that mean a lot to people. And if you ask them straight up,\nthey might not be able to articulate that, but it means a lot. When it's off,\nwhen something is off, it bothers them. - Right. - But to reverse-engineer that,\nto figure that out for a person who might not sense those little\nsubtleties of human interaction is tough. - That's a good point to jump in there, too, on\nempathy because there is some perception in the community that people with autism lack\nempathy, and I don't think that's the case at all. I can only speak for\nmyself. I feel fairly empathetic, but I think the problem is a\ncommunication one, and it works in both directions, whereas I don't know how\nyou're feeling, so it's hard for me to be empathetic with it until you\ncommunicate to me what it is you're experiencing. Then once I know, once I have\nan understanding of what's going on in your head, I can feel incredibly sorry for\nyou. But until then, I'm going to assume you're going to handle it just like I would in\nyour position, in my case, with what I know now. - What advice would you give to people, on\nthe other side, how they can help you be a better friend or better partner\nor better colleague? How should they communicate with you to help,\nlike, give more information? - Yeah, be really specific. And don't\nassume I'm going to pick up on clues and nuance and subtlety. So if you're trying to nudge me into a particular behavior,\nyou're much better off saying, \"Dave, this is what you need to do.\" - Have I failed in any way today? - No, not yet. - All right. What score would you\ngive me out of one to ten? Am I a six? A seven? On the communication?\n7.5? Floating point. Nice. Masking. You've got to\ntell me what that is. Um, it's a significant experience for many\non the spectrum. What is masking and tell me about any of the experiences\nyou've had with masking? - So masking is, and it's probably not the right\nway to describe it, but it's the act of acting normal. And that is,\nhow do I conduct myself in a social situation in a way that other\nneurotypical people are going to, or that other people who are neurotypical are going to receive and\naccept it the right way? And Everything you do in a social interaction,\nfrom waving my hands to making fa- fa- facial expressions to tone of voice\nto posture, it's a huge contrivance and it's work. So it comes natural to most people; it's just\nwhat they do, and cool people do it really well. But for somebody on the spectrum,\nyou've got to fake it all. - Yeah, acting normal. - There's a song by Rush, you know the band? - Yes. - Limelight. And it's written by Neil Peart. I only\nspeculate about people who have passed on, so I've got a sense he was probably on\nthe spectrum. But the line is something like, \"All the world's indeed a stage/\nAnd we are merely players/Performers and portrayers/Each another's audience.\"\nAnd he talks at length in the song about, you know, not being able to treat\nstrangers as friends and being able to fake an affect and all that. So it seems like\nhe's struggling with masking a lot in the song. And I have no idea, but\nthat's what I took from it. - Yeah. You described\nmeltdowns as an overwhelming experience. Can you describe meltdowns?\nWhat typically triggers a meltdown? - Generally, it is... it's when you're emotionally\noverwhelmed to the point that you can't manage your behavior anymore. And so\nyou see it in the movie Rain Man when he's trying to get on the airplane and he's\nkind of forced and he starts losing it. That's a meltdown. Or I've\nseen it on... They did kind of a... Well, actually, probably the\nbest portrayal I've seen in media is, What's the TV show where\nthe doctor is autistic? Anyway, there's a TV show where\na doctor's autistic and he's a surgeon, and he is eventually\nbanned from surgery because of his autism, and he's always wanted to be a surgeon,\nand he has a complete meltdown. It's a pretty good portrayal on television, so. - What is actually happening? Like, there's a\nthreshold you cross where it's just like... - Yeah, the switch flips. - It's like a blue screen\n(laughs) essentially- - Yeah, kind of. - ...for the brain algorithm? - So the switch flips. You go into a primitive brain.\nYour frontal cortex shuts down to an extent, I think, so you don't have the\nbenefit of decision-making and filtering. You're a very\nreptilian brain in that state. And it's really a panic state. And\nso it's a panic and a fight or flight response to not being able\nto tolerate the current reality. And perhaps it's been so frustrating or you've\nbeen so randomized or you had a bad travel day or an argument at work or whatever,\nit's added up to the point that something has now triggered you and your brain loses its ability to\nadequately moderate your behavior. - What about love and relationships? What\nare some of the challenges of that? You know, there's a show,\nLove on the Spectrum. - I've heard of it. I've not\nseen it, but I've heard of it. - Because certain aspects, like\nliteral interpretation of things, it just makes the complexity of relationships, of romantic\nrelationships even more explicit in that, in that context. - You know, I've been married 31\nyears and together for 37, so a long history there, and I think our first\nindication that we knew we were very different was we were sitting in the car\none night out front of the house at dark. And across the street there's kind of a\nnice house and it has these big brick pillars that are linked by, like, anchor\nchains and it forms a fence around the yard. And I'm looking at these things 'cause\nthey're about two feet square and they got capstone and I'm like, \"You know, I wonder\nif they're hollow or are they backfilled? Are they filled with concrete or what?\" And\nmy now wife looks at me and she's like, \"What's wrong with you? Why do you have a\nplace in your head that cares about that?\" - Yeah, that's great. - And we just knew in the moment that I was\npassionately involved and caring, and she was passionately involved, and why would\nyou even worry about that kind of thing? We knew we were very different, so. - Yeah, very specific,\nseemingly irrelevant details. - But, uh- I was never good with\npeople. I don't get it when people like me, I guess. And so I... And my son\nis the same way 'cause they don't fall very far from the tree, and I got them\na T-shirt that says, \"If you're hitting on me, please let me know and be\nspecific because I'm clueless.\" And it's very similar for me. I\nmean, I had to be around a long time and kind of grow on people because I had\nno game because I had no ability to do the social dances that that whole thing\nrequires, so my only option is to just be myself, and that works for some people. - Were you able to say, like, \"I\nlove you,\" that kind of stuff? - Yeah. I mean, her family was way more open\nwith that kind of thing than mine was. - Yeah. - And so it was a growing period for me.\nBut, yeah, that's not a problem I have. - Okay. All right. But it seems, like, unimportant. Like, what is\nthat actually accomplishing? - Well, now we do a lot of affirmation\nand checking. Like, in the last couple of years, we do a thing where\nshe'll just be like, \"You good?\" I'm like, \"Yeah.\" And there's two steps to that.\nThere's the, \"Are you good?\" and then there's my response. 'Cause if I'm like,\n\"Yeah.\"... she knows something's up. - Yeah. So- - And so there's always this pinging back\nand forth because there's not the ability to read people just from looking at them\nto know what's going on, so we have this explicit check mechanism, I think,\nwhere we... Developed that. - So there's a vast chasm\nbetween \"yeah\" and \"neh.\" Again, that subtlety of\nhuman communication. You've written about the\nexperience that people have of feeling, quote, \"a little bit autistic.\" Could you\nelaborate on this concept? - Yeah, I think a lot of people, maybe 10\nto 20% of the population, is somewhere on the autism spectrum, but isn't impacted\nby it enough that it rises to the level of a disorder. But they still have many of\nthe characteristics that arise from autism. And I think if they can\nunderstand and identify and manage some of those behaviors in an optimal\nway, they can both leverage them and take advantage of some of the skills and mediate some\nof the deficits and problems that come with it. And I wrote it mostly for my kids\nbecause none of them, as far as I know, have ASD, but they've all got certain\naspects of my behavior that are particularly related to it, so I thought I'd write a little\nmanual for them, basically. - Hmm. Why do you think so many\nprogrammers, like excellent, like great programmers and great\nengineers are on the spectrum? - I think it's that single-minded focus\nand the ability to reduce a problem, and to be ultimately curious about\nwhat's inside stuff. That's been an obsession for me my whole life, what's inside.\nI gotta take my mom's oven apart because I gotta know how the flip clock works.\nAnd I think that's a good habit to have if you're\ngoing to be a programmer. - And being willing, being excited\nto get into the details. What's a cool thing you hope\nto program or build this year? What are you working\non? So we got the RL learning how to play Tempest. Where are\nyou on that, by the way? Like, what's the ETA on success\nand dominance? Like victory? - Well, it's very close to working. I\nthink now it's tweaking the model size and layers and stuff like that to get it to learn\npast the one threshold, but, you know, it's a couple thousand lines of Lua and it's a couple thousand lines\nof Python and they all interact and they all work, so it's like 95% of the work is done\nnow. It's tuning hyperparameters and hoping for the best. - So it's already a success in a sense, but\nnow you're seeing how far can this go? - Yeah, my goal was for it\nto be able to beat me. - That's a tough goal. - It is, but lots of games now are, you know,\nthey play them better than humans, but maybe not games this complex. - What other cool things are you working\non? What do you hope to build this year? - The PDP-11 stuff, I'm trying to get\nwhat's called an RA82 drive. It's the big 14-inch monster that spins at\n3600 RPM and sounds like a washing machine. And then I'll find the controller card\nand write the code and integrate it into the driver and try to get that all working. - What kind of code are\nyou trying to run on it? - I'm gonna have to get the\ndriver stack to work, so I have to incorporate the\ndriver for it into the kernel. - You built a machine recently\nwith one terabyte of RAM. How did that happen, and why? - So we have a project called GitHub Primes.\nIf you just search for GitHub Primes, you'll find it, and it is... - GitHub Primes. - ...a single set of prime number\nalgorithms implemented in about 100 different languages. So it's the exact\nsame algorithm, and we require that you follow certain rules to make it fair. And then you express that algorithm in whatever\nlanguage you choose to the best of your ability, and we run a benchmark every night\nand we compile the results and find out which languages are fastest. - Is this the one? Oh, so this is... And\nthis is what you're using this for? Oh, so this machine runs those tests? Okay, you've got to tell me about this project.\nThis is an epic project. So you're comparing the performance of the different\nprogramming languages. - Of all these languages, so they all get built into\nan individual Docker container, and then they all run. And so... - This is an incredible project. This\nis really, really cool. It's really measuring the performance of the different\nlanguages. So what have you learned about which languages? Like, which\nlanguage usually wins? - Zig, I think, right now. - Zig. - It varies. People will make an improvement to the\nC++, then it'll pass for a while, and then the Zig guys will get angry and\ncome back and make it faster. - So Zig, Rust, C++, C? And what kind of code\nis being run? What's the piece of code that they're trying to run\nto measure the performance? - So what they're doing is they're solving\nthe primes up to 100 million as many times per second as they can\nin a five-second loop. - And so it's a loop, got it. Over and\nover and over and over and over again. - Yeah, on all cores. - So what- - Across all CPUs. - What about, like, how the program\nis written? Does that vary? - No. So you can do anything you want, but it\nhas to be a prime sieve. You're allowed to use one bit per integer at most, so you can't\nuse a byte, which is cheaper and easier. There are a number of rules like that that you\nhave to allocate the memory within your timed loop. And so we have a set\nof rules and we have some solutions that don't follow the rules like\nthe 6502, because you've only got 64K, you can't do a 100 million sieve. So there's\na lot of solutions like that that we run as exhibition projects, but among the main\nlanguages, they all follow the same rules, and so it really should just be how the\nalgorithm is expressed in that language. And many of them use the\nsame backend compiler, so it really is how you're expressing it and the limitations\nor the benefits of that language. - Are multiple submissions\nallowed per language? - Yeah, yeah. So if you look in the\nC, there's like five, I think. - Okay. And then some of them might\nuse different compilers, or no? - Yeah, some are GCC, some are Clang, LLVM. - I'm looking at a snapshot here from a couple\nyears ago. Zig was at the top, then Rust, then Nim, Haskell. Oh, no, this is not,\nthis is not ordered by slowness, or is it? - Yep. So C would be 1.5\ntimes as long as Zig. - Wow. Okay. Fascinating.\nIt's a super cool project. - And we've got in crazy languages like\nPowerShell. There's a version in PowerShell, and stuff like that. - So this is automated, in terms of\norganization of how the submissions are done. There's a structure to it? That's cool. - Yeah, there's two guys\nover in Europe, Rucker and Tudor, who basically own this now. I\nstarted with just three languages. I did Python, C#, and C++. And I checked\nthem in and I published the episode. And then people started throwing more solutions\nin there and it just got out of hand, so I had to get somebody to manage that\none, and they've been great doing that. - What's the happiest moment for you when\nyou're programming and building a thing? What do you enjoy most? - I think the most fun for me is when I\nbuild something complex and I've thought through how it should work, and then\nI run it and it does work that way. That creates intense satisfaction. So seeing the results come out the way\nthat I planned them and have it work, because it rarely does\nthe first time, but... - Yeah, or especially if it\ndoes work the first time. - I never trust that. I always\nfeel like I'm missing something. - That's true. But, you know, with compiled languages like with C++, that's always\na good feeling. You write a bunch of code and you compile it all, it compiles\nwithout warnings, without errors. It's a cool feeling. What\ndo you think is the future of programming? Now, I don't know\nhow much you've got to really experience the impact of LLMs with code generation. Have you used Cursor much,\nCursor VSCode with code generation? - Yeah, I've done a ton of it for the Python\nside because I'm not great with Python and I'm kind of new to it. So I found it\nvery helpful because I've learned a lot from watching the code that it generates\nif I don't know how to do something. Because if I were to write Python from\nscratch, it's going to be about four times as long as what the AI can crank out because\nPython can be pretty terse if you're good at it. - Oh, that's cool. So you essentially\nlearned Python for this project? - Yeah. - So this is a good case study of a great programmer in C++ quickly\nlearning a language. - Yeah, I'm vibe coding my\nway through it, I guess. - Vibe coding your way through it.\nI mean, that is a really powerful use case to learn a language for. If\nyou're already a good programmer, to learn either a new language or a new way to approach a problem by having it\ngenerate it, because you already, you probably understand the Python code it generates. like without actually looking\nup any of the syntax. - Yeah, it's all pretty self-explanatory once you see it,\nbut creating it from whole cloth is a little different. so. - Yeah, but you still have to learn how to\nprogram in order to use it in that way. - Oh, and to read it and to know what to tell it\nto do next and all that. Yeah, I don't think you can vibe code yourself if you're just\nnew and haven't coded. But if you're a good programmer, AI can make\nyou incredibly powerful. - What do you think is the future of programming?\nLike 5, 10, 20 years from now, this whole process? Now vibe coding is\nkind of a fun meme thing, because you still have to be...\nThe people that don't know how to program and are just vibe coding are almost\nentirely creating systems that are not usable in production. They're\nnot... It's very difficult to create a product.\nAnd the people who are already great programmers kind of vibe code\njust for, in the way that you're doing it. They're basically, it's just\na fancy auto-complete, and they end up editing it, or it's\na way to learn a new API, or new language, or a new\nwhatever, a new specific use case, or maybe a different kind of\ngooey component or something like that. But as they get smarter and smarter,\nwe don't know where the ceiling is. That might change the nature of\nwhat it means to be a programmer. So, do you think about that? - I do. I think... I don't want to say prompt\nengineer, but I think it's going to be something like that in the sense that if you're an\narchitect building a bridge, at some point, guys were down there welding beams together. But\nnow you're dragging things around in AutoCAD and assembling from big pre-formed sections.\nAnd I assume that's what programming will be like. You won't be in there throwing\nindividual lines of code around, you'll be moving components and interfaces and describing to the AI what those interactions\nshould be and letting it build the components. But I think we're still\nquite a ways from it being able to whole cloth generate... You can't say,\n\"Give me a Linux kernel that's compatible with Linux.\" One day, we'll be able to and it'll\ncrank it out, but we're not there yet. - Does it make you sad that we're\nclimbing the layers of abstraction so quickly? So you, somebody that\nused to do machine code and then assembly, then C and C++,\nthat we're getting to a point where we're vibe coding\nwith natural language? - Yeah, I kind of came up at a really\nfortunate time, I think, because I had to come up with the technology over\nthe course of 30 or 40 years, so I understand TTL logic and I\ncan use AI to write code, and I kind of know all the pieces in between. There\ncertainly are holes in my knowledge, but I think the only way to have got that level\nof knowledge or the completeness of that picture is to have lived it for that long. And it's going to be hard to duplicate\nthat for people starting now. - What do you think is the\nmeaning of this whole thing? Of existence, of life,\nwhatever is going on here? - Making cool stuff. I\nguess, fundamentally, what I care about is being able to make\ncomplex things that are useful to other people, which leverages my abilities\nin a way that allows me to be creative and to create things that\nother people can use in a way that if I was limited to painting or sculpting or\nwhatever in the classic arts, I would be hopeless. And so for me, that's\nreally the meaning of life. And then maybe you raise a couple of\ngood kids to hand the baton off to. - Yeah, and you've created a lot of\ncool stuff over your life that impacted millions, probably\nbillions of people. And now you're inspiring...\nYou're creating cool stuff for everyone to see\non your YouTube and you're inspiring people in that way. So for everything\nyou've done in the past and everything you're doing now, I'm a big fan.\nI'm really grateful for what you're doing and grateful that we got a\nchance to talk today. Thank you, brother. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with\nDave Plummer. To support this podcast, please check out our sponsors in the description\nand now, let me leave with some words from Bjarne Stroustrup, creator\nof C++, and somebody who, by the way, I interviewed a long, long time ago,\nEpisode 48 of the podcast. He said, \"There are only two kinds of\nlanguages. The ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.\" Thank you\nfor listening and hope to see you next time.",
