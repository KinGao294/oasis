  "full_text": "- The following is a conversation with\nMichael Levin, his second time on the podcast. He is one of the most\nfascinating and brilliant biologists and scientists I've\never had the pleasure of speaking with. He and his labs at Tufts\nUniversity study and build biological systems that help us\nunderstand the nature of intelligence, agency, memory, consciousness, and life\nin all of its forms here on Earth, and beyond. This is the Lex Fridman\nPodcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the\ndescription, where you can also find links to contact me, ask\nquestions, give feedback, and so on. And now, dear friends,\nhere's Michael Levin. You write that the central question\nat the heart of your work from biological systems to\ncomputational ones is, \"How do embodied minds arise in the\nphysical world, and what determines the capabilities and\nproperties of those minds?\" Can you unpack that question for us,\nand maybe begin to answer it? - Well, the fundamental tension\nis in both the first-person, the second-person, and\nthird-person descriptions of mind. So, in third-person, we want to\nunderstand how do we recognize them, and how do we know, looking out into\nthe world, what degree of agency there is, and how best to relate to the\ndifferent systems that we find. And are our intuitions any good when\nwe look at something and it looks really stupid and mechanical,\nversus it really looks like there's something cognitive going on there? How\ndo we get good at recognizing them? Then there's the second-person, which\nis the control, and that's both for engineering but also for regenerative medicine,\nwhen you want to tell the system to do something, right? What kind of tools are\nyou going to use? And this is a major part of my framework, is that all of these\nkinds of things are operational claims. Are you going to use the tools\nof hardware rewiring, of control theory and cybernetics,\nof behavior science, of psychoanalysis and love and friendship? Like,\nwhat are the interaction protocols that you bring, right? And then in first-person,\nit's this notion of having an inner perspective and being a system that\nhas valence and cares about the outcome of things. Makes decisions and\nhas memories and tells a story about itself and the outside world. And\nhow can all of that exist and still be consistent with the laws of physics\nand chemistry and various other things that we see around us? So that, that I find to\nbe maybe the most interesting and the most important mystery for all\nof us to both on the science and also on the personal level.\nSo that's what I'm interested in. - So your work is focused on starting at the physics, going all\nthe way to friendship and love and psychoanalysis. - Yeah, although, actually I would turn that\nupside down. I think that pyramid is backwards, and I think it's behavior science at the\nbottom. I think it's behavior science all the way. I think in certain ways,\neven math is the behavior of a certain kind of being that\nlives in a latent space, and physics is what we call systems\nthat at least look to be amenable to a very simple, low\nagency kind of model, and so on. But that's what I'm interested\nin, is understanding that and developing applications. Because\nit's very important to me that what we do is\ntransition deep ideas and philosophy into actual practical\napplications that not only make it clear whether we're making any progress\nor not, but also allow us to relieve suffering and make life better for\nall sentient beings, and enable to, you know, enable us and others to reach\ntheir full potential. So these are very practical things, I think. - Behavioral science, I suppose, is more\nsubjective, and mathematics and physics is more objective? Would that\nbe the clear difference? - The idea basically is that\nwhere something is on that spectrum, and I've called it the spectrum\nof persuadability. You could call it the spectrum of intelligence or agency or something\nlike that. I like the notion of the spectrum of of the spectrum of persuadability, because\nit's an engineering approach. It means that these are not things you can decide or have feelings about from\na philosophical armchair. You have to make a hypothesis about\nwhich tools, which interaction protocols you're going to bring to a given system, and\nthen we all get to find out how that worked out for you, right? So you could be wrong in\nmany ways, in both directions. You can guess too high or too low, or wrong in\nvarious ways, and then we can all find out how that's working out. And so, I do\nthink that the behavior of certain objects is well-described\nby specific formal rules, and we call those things the subject of\nmathematics. And then there are some other things whose behavior really\nrequires the kinds of tools that we use in behavioral\ncognitive neuroscience, and those are other kinds of minds\nthat we think we study in biology or in psychology\nor other sciences. - Why are you using the term persuadability?\nWho are you persuading, and of what? - Well- - In this context. - Yeah, the beginning of my work\nis very much in regenerative medicine, in bioengineering,\nthings like that. So for those kinds of systems, the\nquestion is always, how do you get the system to do what you want it to do? So\nthere are cells, there are molecular networks, there are materials, there\nare organs and tissues and synthetic beings and biobots and whatever.\nSo the idea is, if I want your cells to regrow a limb, for example, if you're\ninjured and I want your cells to regrow a limb, I have many options. Some\nof those options are I'm going to micromanage all of the molecular\nevents that have to happen, right? And there's an incredible number of those.\nOr maybe I just have to micromanage the cells and the stem cell\nkinds of signaling factors. Or maybe actually I can give\nthe cells a very high-level prompt that says, \"You really should\nbuild a limb,\" and convince them to do it, right? And so which of those is possible? I mean, clearly people have a\nlot of intuitions about that. If you ask standard people in regenerative medicine and\nmolecular biology, they're going to say, \"Well, that convincing thing is crazy. What we really should\nbe doing is talking to the cells, or better yet, the molecular networks.\" And\nin fact, all the excitement of the biological sciences today are at\nsingle molecule approaches and big data and genomics and all of\nthat. The assumption is that, going down is where the action's\ngoing to be, going down in scale, and... I think that's wrong.\nBut the thing that we can say for sure is that you can't\nguess that. You have to do experiments and you have to see because you\ndon't know where any given system is on that spectrum of persuadability. And it\nturns out that every time we look and we take tools from behavioral science,\nso learning different kinds of training, different kinds of\nmodels that are used in active inference and surprise minimization\nand perceptual multi-stability and visual illusions and all these\nkinds of interesting things. Stress perception and memory, active\nmemory reconstruction. All these interesting things.\nWhen we apply them outside the brain to other kinds of living\nsystems, we find novel discoveries and novel capabilities, actually being able\nto get the material to do new things that nobody had ever found before.\nAnd precisely because I think that people didn't look at it from those perspectives, they assumed that it was a\nlow-level kind of thing. So when I say persuadability, I mean different types\nof approaches, right? And we all know if you want to persuade your\nwind-up clock to do something, you're not going to argue with it or make it feel guilty or anything.\nYou're going to have to get in there with a wrench and you're gonna have to, you know, tune it up and do whatever.\nIf you want to do that same thing to a cell or a thermostat or an animal or\na human, you're going to be using other sets of tools that we've given\nother names to. And so that's... Now, of course, that spectrum, the important thing is that\nas you get to the right of that spectrum, whereas the agency of the system goes up, it is no\nlonger just about persuading it to do things. It's a bidirectional relationship,\nwhat Richard Watson would call a mutual vulnerable knowing. So the idea\nis that on the right side of that spectrum, when systems reach the\nhigher levels of agency, the idea is that you are willing to let that\nsystem persuade you of things as well. You know, in molecular biology, you do\nthings, hopefully the system does what you want to do, but you haven't changed. You're\nstill exactly the way you came in. But on the right side of that spectrum, if\nyou're having interactions with even cells, but certainly, you know, dogs,\nother animals, maybe other creatures soon, you're not the same at\nthe end of that interaction as you were going in. It's a mutual bidirectional\nrelationship. So it's not just you persuading something else, it's not you\npushing things. It's a mutual bidirectional set of\npersuasions, whether those are purely intellectual or of other kinds. - So in order to be\neffective at persuading an intelligent being, you yourself have to be persuadable. So the closer in intelligence\nyou are to the thing you're trying to persuade, the more persuadable\nyou have to become, hence the mutual vulnerable knowing. What a term. - Yeah. Richard, you should talk to Richard\nas well. He's an amazing guy and he's got some very interesting ideas about\nthe intersection of cognition and evolution. But I think what you\nbring up is very important because, There has to be a kind of impedance match between\nwhat you're looking for and the tools that you're using. I think the reason\nphysics always sees mechanism and not minds is that physics uses\nlow agency tools. You've got voltmeters and rulers and things like\nthis. And if you use those tools as your interface, all you're ever going to\nsee is mechanisms and those kinds of things. If you want to see minds, you\nhave to use a mind, right? You have to have some degree of resonance between your\ninterface and the thing you're hoping to find. - You said this about physics before. Can\nyou just linger on that and expand on it, what you mean, why\nphysics is not enough to understand life, to understand mind,\nto understand intelligence? You make a lot of controversial statements with your\nwork. That's one of them 'cause there's a lot of physicists that believe they can understand\nlife, the emergence of life, the origin of life, the origin of intelligence\nusing the tools of physics. In fact, all the other tools\nare a distraction to those folks. If you want to understand\nfundamentally anything, you have to start at physics to them. And you're saying,\n\"No, physics is not enough.\" - Here's the issue. Everything\nhere hangs on what it means to understand, okay? For me, because to\nunderstand doesn't just mean have some sort of pleasing model that seems to capture\nsome important aspect of what's going on. It also means that you have\nto be generative and creative in terms of capabilities. So for\nme, that means if I tell you this is what I think about cognition in cells\nand tissues, it means, for example, that I think we're going to be able\nto take those ideas and use them to produce new regenerative medicine that\nactually helps people in various ways, right? It's just an example. So if you think\nas a physicist you're going to have a complete understanding of\nwhat's going on from that perspective of fields and particles,\nand, you know, who knows what else is at the bottom there. Does that mean then that when\nsomebody is missing a finger or has a psychological problem, or\nyou know, has these other high-level issues, that you have something for\nthem, that you're going to be able to do something? Because my claim is that you're\nnot going to, and even if, even if you have some theory of physics\nthat is completely compatible with everything that's going on, that is... it's not\nenough. That's not specific enough to enable you to solve the problems you need to solve. In the\nend, when you need to solve those problems, the person you're going to go to is not\na physicist. It's going to be either a biologist or a psychiatrist, or who\nknows, but it's not going to be a physicist. And the simple example\nis this. You know, let's say, let's say someone comes in here and tells\nyou a beautiful mathematical proof, okay? It's just really, you know, deep and beautiful,\nand there's a physicist nearby, and he says, \"Well, I know exactly what happened.\nThere were some air particles that moved from that guy's mouth to your\near. I see what goes on. It moved the cilia in your ear and the electrical signals went up to your brain.\" I mean, we have\na complete accounting of what happened, done and done. But if you want to understand\nwhat's the more important aspect of that interaction, it's not going to be found in\nthe Physics Department. It's going to be found in the Math Department. So that's my only claim is\nthat physics is an amazing lens with which to view the world, but you're capturing\ncertain things, and if you want to stretch to sort of encompass\nthese other things, it just, we just don't call that physics\nanymore, right? We call that something else. - Okay. But you're kind of\nspeaking about the super complex organisms. Can we go to the\nsimplest possible thing where you first take a step over the line, the Cartesian\ncut, as you've called it, from the non-mind to mind, from\nthe non-living to living? The simplest possible\nthing, isn't that in the realm of physics to understand? How do\nwe understand that first step where you're like, that thing is no\nmind, probably non-living, and here's a living thing that\nhas a mind. That line. I think that's a really interesting line. Maybe\nyou can speak to the line as well, and can physics help us understand it? - Yeah, let's talk about it. Well, first of all,\nof course it can. I mean, it can help, meaning that I'm not saying physics is not helpful. Of\ncourse it's helpful. It's a very important lens on one slice of what's going on in any of\nthese systems. But I think the most important thing I can say about that\nquestion is I don't believe in any such line. I don't believe any of\nthat exists. I think there is a continuum. I think we as humans like to demarcate areas on that continuum\nand give them names because it makes life easier, and then we have a\nlot of battles over you know, so-called category errors when people, they\ntransgress those those categories. I think most of those categories at this\npoint, they may have done some good service at the beginning of when the scientific\nmethod was getting started and so on. I think at this point they mostly hold back\nscience. Many, many categories that we can talk about are at this point very\nharmful to progress, because what those categories do is they prevent you\nfrom hoarding tools. If you think that living things are\nfundamentally different from non-living things, or if you think\nthat cognitive things are these like advanced brainy things that are\nvery different from other kinds of systems, what you're not going to do is\ntake the tools that are appropriate to these to, to these kind of cognitive systems,\nright? So the, so the tools that have been developed in, in behavioral science and so on,\nyou're never going to try them in other contexts because, because you've already decided that there's\na categorical difference, that it would be a categorical error to apply them. And, and people\nsay this to me all the time is that you're making a category error, and as, as if these\ncategories were given to us, you know, about from, from, from on high, and we have to,\nwe have to obey them forevermore. The categories should change with the\nscience. So yeah, I don't believe in any such line, and I think\na physics story is very often a useful part of the\nstory, but for most interesting things, it's not the entire story. - Okay. So if there's no line, is it still useful\nto talk about things like the origin of life? That's the, the, one of the big\nopen mysteries before us as a human civilization, as scientifically\nminded curious homo sapiens. How did this whole thing start?\nAre you saying there is no start? Is there a point where you\ncould say that invention right there was the start of it all on Earth? - My suggestion is that\nmuch better than trying to... in my experience, much better\nthan trying to define any kind of a line, okay, because, because inevitably\nI've never, I've never found, and the people try to ... Th- y- you know, we play this\ngame all the time when I make my continuum claim. Then people try to come up, \"Okay, well, what\nabout this?\" And I haven't found one yet that really shoots that down that, that you can't\nzoom in and say, \"Yeah, okay, but right before then this happened, and if we really look\nclose, like here's a bunch of steps in between,\" right? Pretty much everything ends up being\na continuum, but here's what I think is much more interesting than trying to make that\nline. I think what's, what's really more useful is trying to understand the\ntransformation process. What is it that happened to scale up? And I'll give\nyou a really dumb example. And we al- and we always get into this 'cause people,\npeople often really, really don't like this continuum view. The word adult, right? E- everybody is going to say, \"Look, I know what\na baby is. I know what an adult is. You're crazy to say that there's no difference.\" I'm not saying\nthere's no difference. What I'm saying is the word adult is really helpful in court\nbecause, because, because you just need to move things along, and so we've\ndecided that if you're 18, you're an adult. However, what it hides\nis, is ... Th- what, what it completely conceals is the fact\nthat first of all, nothing happens on your 18th birthday, right? That's\nspecial. Second, if you actually look at the data, the car rental companies actually\nhave a much better estimate because they actually look at the accident statistics and\nthey'll say it's about 25 is really what you're looking for, right? So theirs is a\nlittle better. It's less arbitrary. But in either case, what it's hiding is\nthe fact that we do not have a good story of what happened from the time that\nyou were an egg to the time that you're the supposed adult and what is\nthe scaling of personal responsibility, decision-making,\njudgment. These are deep fundamental questions. Nobody\nwants to get into that every time somebody, you know, has a\ntraffic ticket. So, okay, we've just decided that there's this adult idea.\nAnd of course, it does come up in court because then somebody has a brain tumor or\nsomebody's eaten too many Twinkies or something has happened. You say, \"Look, that wasn't me. Whoever\ndid that, I was on drugs.\" \"Well, why'd you take the drugs?\" \"Well, that was, you know, that was\nyesterday. Me today, this is I'm...\" Right? So we get into these very deep questions\nthat are completely glossed over by this idea of an adult. So I\nthink once you start scratching the surface, most of these categories are\nlike that. They're convenient and they're good. You know, I get into this\nwith neurons all the time. I'll ask people, \"What's a neuron? Like, what's\nreally a neuron?\" And yes, if you're in neurobiology 101, of course you\njust say like, \"These are what neurons look like. Let's just study the neuroanatomy\nand we're done.\" But if you really want to understand what's going on, well, neurons\ndevelop from other types of cells and that was a slow and\ngradual process, and most of the cells in your body do the things that neurons\ndo. So what really is a neuron, right? So once you start scratching this, this\nhappens, and I have some things that I think are coming out of our lab and others\nthat are very interesting about the origin of life. But I don't think it's\nabout finding that one boon like this is. Yeah, there will be... There are innovations,\nright? There are innovations that allow you to scale in an\namazing way, for sure. And there are lots of people that study those, right?\nSo things like thermodynamic, kind of metabolic things and all kinds of architectures\nand so on. But I don't think it's about finding a line. I think it's\nabout finding a scaling process. - ... the scaling process, but\nthen there is more rapid scaling and there are slower\nscaling. So innovation, invention, I think is\nuseful to understand so you can predict how likely it is\non other planets, for example. Or to be able to describe the likelihood of these kinds of\nphenomena happening in certain kinds of environments. Again,\nspecifically in answering how many alien civilizations there are. That's why it's useful. But it\nis also useful on a scientific level to have categories, not just\nbecause it makes us feel good and fuzzy inside, but because it makes conversation possible and productive, I think. If\neverything is a spectrum, it's... It becomes difficult to make\nconcrete statements, I think. Like, we even use the terms\nof biology and physics. Those are categories. Technically,\nit's all the same thing, really. Fundamentally, it's all the same.\nThere's no difference between biology and physics. But it's a useful\ncategory. If you go to the physics department and the biology department,\nthose people are different in, in... at some kind of categorical way. So\nsomehow, I don't know what the chicken or the egg is, but the categories. Maybe\nthe categories create themselves because of the way we think about them and\nuse them in language, but it does seem useful. - Let me make the opposite argument.\nThey're absolutely useful. They're useful specifically when you want to\ngloss over certain things. The categories are exactly useful when\nthere's a whole bunch of stuff. And this is what's important about science, is like\nthe art of being able to say something without first having to\nsay everything, right? Which would make it impossible. So\ncategories are great when you want to say, \"Look, I know there's a bunch of stuff\nhidden here. I'm going to ignore all that and we're just going to like, let's\nget on with this particular thing.\" And all of that is great as long as you don't\nlose track of the stuff that you glossed over. And that's what I'm afraid is\nhappening in a lot of different ways. And in terms of... Look, I'm very\ninterested in life beyond Earth and all these kinds of things so\nthat we should also talk about what I call SUTI, S-U-T-I,\nthe search for unconventional terrestrial intelligences. I think\nwe got much bigger issues than actually recognizing aliens off\nEarth. But I'll make this claim. I think the categorical stuff is\nactually hurting that search. Because, if we try to define\ncategories with the kinds of criteria that we've gotten used\nto, we are going to be very poorly set up to recognize life in\nnovel embodiments. I think we have a kind of mind blindness. I think this\nis really key. To me, the cognitive spectrum is much more interesting\nthan the spectrum of life. I think really what we're talking about is\nthe spectrum of cognition. And, it is... Well, I know it's weird as a\nbiologist to say, I don't think life is all that interesting a category. I think the\ncategories of different types of minds, I think is extremely interesting. And\nto the extent that we think our categories are complete and are cutting\nnature at its joints, we are going to be very poorly placed to\nrecognize novel systems. So for example, a lot of people will say, \"Well,\nthis is intelligent and this isn't,\" right? And there's a binary thing. And\nthat's useful occasionally; that's useful for some things. I would like\nto say, instead of that, let's make a let's admit that we have a spectrum.\nBut instead of just saying, \"Oh, look, everything's intelligent,\" right? Because\nif you do that, you're right, you can't do anything after that. What I'd like to say\ninstead is, no, you have to be very specific as to what kind and how much. In other\nwords, what problem spaces they're operating in? What kind of mind does it have? What\nkind of cognitive capacities does it have? You have to actually be much more specific.\nAnd we can even name, right? That's fine. We can name different types of, I mean,\nthis is doing predictive processing. This can't do that, but it can form\nmemories. What kind? Well, habituation and sensitization, but not associative\nconditioning. It's fine to have categories for specific capabilities, but it actually makes for much more rigorous\ndiscussions because it makes you say what is it that you are claiming this thing\ndoes, and it works in both directions. So, some people will say, \"Well,\nthat's a cell. That can't be intelligent.\" And I'll say, \"Well, let's be\nvery specific. Here are some claims about... Here's some problem solving that it's doing.\nTell me why that doesn't... you know, why doesn't that match?\" Or in the opposite direction,\nsomebody comes to me and says, \"You're right, you're right. You know, the whole, the whole solar\nsystem, man. It's just like this amazing...\" I'm like, \"Whoa, okay. Well, what is it\ndoing?\" Like, \"Tell me what tools of cognitive and behavioral science are you\nusing to reach that conclusion,\" right? And so I think it's actually much more productive\nto take this operational stance and say, \"Tell, tell me what protocols you think you can\ndeploy with this thing that would lead you to use these terms.\" - To have a bit of a meta-conversation about\nthe conversation. I should say that part of the persuadability argument that\nwe two intelligent creatures are doing is me playing devil's advocate\nevery once in a while. And you did the same, which is kind of interesting, taking\nthe opposite view and see what comes out. Because you don't know the result\nof the argument until you have the argument, and it seems productive to just\ntake the other side of the argument. - For sure. It's a very\nimportant thinking aid to first of all, you know, what they call steel\nmanning, right? To try to make the strongest possible case for the other side and to\nask yourself, \"Okay, what are all the, places that I am sort of glossing over\nbecause I don't know exactly what to say? And where are all the holes in\nthe argument, and what would a, you know, a really good critique\nreally look like?\" Yeah. - Sorry to go back there just to linger on the term\nbecause it's so interesting, persuadability. Did I understand correctly that you\nmean that it's kind of synonymous with intelligence? So it's\nan engineering-centric view of an intelligence system. Because\nif it's persuadable, you're more focused on how can I steer the goals\nof the system, the behaviors of the system? Which, meaning an intelligence\nsystem, maybe is a goal-oriented, goal-driven system with agency. And\nwhen you call it persuadable, you're thinking more like, \"Okay, here's\nan intelligence system that I'm interacting with that I would like\nto get it to accomplish certain things.\" But fundamentally,\nthey're synonymous or correlated, persuadability\nand intelligence? - They're definitely correlated. So,\nlet me... I wanna preface this with one thing. When I say it's an\nengineering perspective, I don't mean that the standard tools that\nwe use in engineering and this idea of enforced control and\nsteering is how we should view all of the world. I'm not saying\nthat at all. And I wanna be very clear on that because people do\nemail me and say, \"This engineering thing. You're going to drain the\nlife and the majesty out of these high-end, like, human conversation.\" My whole\npoint is not that at all. It's that of course at the right side of the\nspectrum it doesn't look like engineering anymore, right? It looks like friendship and\nlove and psychoanalysis and all these other tools that we have. But here's what\nI want to do. I want to be very specific to my colleagues in regenerative medicine\nand everything. Just imagine if I, you know, if I went to a bioengineering department\nor a genetics department and I started talking about high-level, you know, cognition\nand psychoanalysis, right? They don't want to hear that. So I focus\non the engineering approach... Because I want to say, look,\nthis is not a philosophical problem. This is not a linguistics\nproblem. We are not trying to define terms in different ways to make anybody feel\nfuzzy. What I'm telling you is, if you want to reach certain capabilities, if you want\nto reprogram cancer, if you want to regrow new organs, you want to defeat aging,\nyou want to do these specific things, you are leaving too much on the table by\nmaking an unwarranted assumption that the low-level tools that we have, so\nthese are the rules of chemistry and the kind of molecular rewiring, that those\nare going to be sufficient to get to where you want to go. It's an assumption\nonly, and it's an unwarranted assumption, and actually, we've done\nexperiments now, so not philosophy, but real experiments, that if you take these\nother tools, you can in fact persuade the system in ways that has never been done\nbefore. And we can unpack all that. But it is absolutely correlated\nwith intelligence, so let me flesh that out a little bit.\nWhat I think is scaling in all of these things, right? Because I keep talking\nabout the scaling, so what is it that's scaling? What I think is scaling is something I\ncall the cognitive light cone, and the cognitive light cone is\nthe size of the biggest goal state that you can pursue.\nThis doesn't mean how far do your senses reach? This doesn't mean how\nfar can you affect it? So the James Webb Telescope has enormous sensory\nreach, but that doesn't mean that's the size of its cognitive light cone. The\nsize of the cognitive light cone is the scale of the biggest goal you can actively\npursue, but I do think it's a useful concept to enable us to think about very\ndifferent types of agents of different composition, different provenance, you\nknow, engineered, evolved, hybrid, whatever, all in the same framework.\nAnd by the way, the reason I use light cone is that it has this idea from physics\nthat you're putting space and time in the same diagram, which I like here. So if\nyou tell me that all your goals revolve around maximizing the amount of\nsugar, the amount of sugar in this, in this, you know,\n10-20 micron radius of spacetime and that you have, you know, 20\nminutes memory going back and maybe five minutes predictive capacity going forward, that tiny\nlittle cognitive light cone, I'm gonna say probably a bacterium. And if you say to\nme that, \"Well, I'm able to care about several hundred yards sort\nof scale, I could never care about what happens three weeks from now, two towns\nover, just impossible,\" I would say you might be a dog. And if you say\nto me, \"Okay, I care about really what happens, you know,\nthe financial markets on Earth, you know, long after I'm dead and this\nand that,\" I'd say you're probably a human. And if you say to me,\n\"I care in the linear range, I actively, I'm not just saying it, I can\nactively care in the linear range about all the living beings on this planet,\" I'm\ngonna say, \"Well, you're not a standard human. You must be something else.\" Because\nhumans, I don't know, standard humans today, I don't think can do that. You must be some kind of a\nbodhisattva or some other thing that has these massive cognitive light cones. So I think what's\nscaling from zero, and I do think it goes all the way down, I think we can talk\nabout even particles doing something like this. the cognitive light cone. And so now this\nis an interesting... here, I'll try for a definition of life or whatever, for whatever\nit's worth. I spent no time trying to make that stick, but if\nwe want it to, I think we call things alive to the extent that the cognitive light cone of that\nthing is bigger than that of its parts. So, in other words, rocks aren't very\nexciting because the things it knows how to do are the things that its parts already know how to\ndo, which is follow gradients and things like that. But living things are\namazing at aligning their their competent parts so that the\ncollective has a larger cognitive light cone than the parts. I'll give you a very\nsimple example that comes up in biology and that comes up in our cancer\nprogram all the time. Individual cells have little tiny cognitive\nlight cones. What are their goals? Well, they're trying\nto manage pH, metabolic state, some other things. There are some\ngoals in transcriptional space, some goals in metabolic space, some goals in physiological state space, but\nthey're generally very tiny goals. One thing evolution did was to provide\na kind of cognitive glue, which we can also talk about, that ties them\ntogether into a multicellular system. And those systems have grandiose goals. They're making limbs, and if you're\na salamander limb and you chop it off, they will regrow that limb with the right number\nof fingers, then they'll stop when it's done. The goal has been achieved. No individual cell\nknows what a finger is or how many fingers you're supposed to have, but the collective absolutely\ndoes. And that process of growing that cognitive light cone from a single cell\nto something much bigger, and of course the failure mode of that process,\nso cancer, right? When cells disconnect, they physiologically disconnect\nfrom the other cells. Their cognitive light cone shrinks. The boundary between self and\nworld, which is what the cognitive light cone defines, shrinks. Now they're back to an amoeba.\nAs far as they're concerned, the rest of the body is just external environment, and they\ndo what amoebas do. They go where life is good. They reproduce as much as they\ncan, right? So that cognitive light cone, that is the thing that I'm talking about\nthat scales. So when we are looking for life, I don't think we're looking\nfor specific materials. I don't think we're looking for specific metabolic\nstates. I think we're looking for scales of cognitive light cone.\nWe're looking for alignment of parts towards bigger goals in spaces that\nthe parts could not comprehend. - And so cognitive light cone, just to make clear, is about goals that\nyou can actively pursue now. You said linear, like\nwe're within reach immediately. - No, I didn't. Sorry, I didn't mean that.\nFirst of all, the goal necessarily is often removed in time. So, in other\nwords, when you're pursuing a goal, it means that you have a separation between\ncurrent state and target state, at minimum. Your thermostat, right? Let's just think\nabout that. There's a separation in time because the thing you're trying to make happen,\nso that the temperature goes to a certain level, is not true right now. And all your actions are\ngoing to be around reducing that error, right? That basic homeostatic loop is all\nabout closing that gap. When I meant... When I said linear range, this\nis what I meant. If I say to you, \"This terrible thing\nhappened to, you know, ten people.\" And you have some\ndegree of activation about it. And then I say, \"No, no, no,\nactually it was 100, you know 10,000 people.\" You're not a\nthousand times more activated about it. You're somewhat more activated, but it's\nnot a thousand. And if I say, \"Oh my God, it was actually 10 million people,\" you're,\nyou're not a million times more activated. You don't have that capacity in the\nlinear range. You sort of... Right? If you think about that curve, we sort\nof reach a saturation point. I have some amazing colleagues in the Buddhist community with\nwhom we've written some papers about this, the radius of compassion is like, \"Can\nyou grow your cognitive system to the point that, yeah, it really isn't just\nyour family group, it really isn't just the hundred people you know in\nyour circle? Can you grow your cognitive light cone to the point\nwhere, no, no, we care about the whole, whether it's all of humanity or the\nwhole ecosystem, or the whole whatever? Can you actually care about that\nthe exact same way that we now care about a much smaller set of people?\nThat's what I mean by linear range. - But this is separated by time\nlike a thermostat, but a bacteria... I mean, if you zoom out far enough, a bacteria could\nbe formulated to have a goal state of creating human\ncivilization. Because if you look at the... You know, bacteria- ...has a role\nto play in the whole history of Earth. So, you know, if you anthropomorphize the goals of a bacteria enough, it has a\nconcrete role to play in the history of the evolution- ...of human civilization.\nSo you do need to, when you define a cognitive light cone, you're looking\nat directly short-term behavior. - Well, no. How do you know what the\ncognitive light cone of something is? Because as you've said, it could be\nalmost anything. The key is you have to do experiments. And the way you do\nexperiments is you put barriers. You have to do interventional experiments. You have to put\nbarriers between it and its goal, and you have to ask what happens. And intelligence\nis the degree of ingenuity that it has in overcoming barriers\nbetween it and its goal. Now, if it were to be that,\nnow, this is, I think, a totally doable but impractical and\nvery expensive experiment. But you could imagine setting up a\nscenario where the bacteria were blocked from becoming more complex.\nAnd you can ask if they would try to find ways around it, or whether\ntheir goals are actually metabolic. And as long as those goals are met, they're\nnot going to actually get around your barrier. The business of putting barriers\nbetween things and their goals is actually extremely powerful\nbecause we've deployed it in all kinds of... I'm sure we'll get to this\nlater, but we've deployed it in all kinds of weird systems that you wouldn't think are\ngoal-driven systems. And what it allows us to do is to get beyond just the anthropomorphizing claims of saying, \"Oh, yeah, I\nthink this thing is trying to do this or that.\" The question is, well,\nlet's do the experiment. And one other thing I want to say about\nanthropomorphizing is people say this to me all the time. I don't think that exists. I think that's kind\nof like, you know. And, and I'll tell you why. I\nthink it's like heresy or, like other, other\nterms that aren't really a thing. Because if you unpack it,\nhere's what anthropomorphism means. Humans have a certain magic,\nand you're making a category error by attributing that magic\nsomewhere else. My point is, we have the same magic that everything has. We have a couple\nof interesting things besides the cognitive light cone and some other stuff, and it\nisn't that you have to keep the humans separate because there's some\nbright line. It's just that same old... All I'm arguing for is the scientific method, really. That's really\nall this is. All I'm saying is you can't just make pronouncements\nsuch as, \"Humans are this,\" and let's not sort of\npush that. You have to do experiments. After you've done your experiments,\nyou can say either, \"I've done it, and I've found... Look at that. That thing actually can predict\nthe future for the next, you know, 12 minutes. Amazing.\" Or you say, \"You know what? I've tried\nall the things in the behaviorist handbook, they just don't help me with this. It's a very low\nlevel of...\" Like, that's it. It's a very low level of intelligence. Fine, right? Done.\nSo that's really all I'm arguing for is an empirical approach, and then things like\nanthropomorphism go away. It's just a matter of, have you done the experiment,\nand what did you find? - And that's actually one of the things\nyou're saying, that if you remove the categorization of things,\nyou can use the tools- ... of one discipline on everything. - You could try. - to try and then see. That's\nthe underpinnings of the criticism of\nanthropomorphization, because, what is that? That's like\npsychoanalysis of another human could technically be\napplied to robots, to AI systems, to more primitive\nbiological systems, and so on. Try. - Yeah. We've used everything\nfrom basic habituation conditioning all the way\nthrough anxiolytics, hallucinogens, all kinds of\ncognitive modification on the range of things that you wouldn't believe. And by the\nway, I'm not the first person to come up with this. So there was a guy named Bose\nwell over 100 years ago who was studying how anesthesia\naffected animals and animal cells, and drawing specific\ncurves around electrical excitability. And he then\nwent and did it with plants and saw some very similar\nphenomena. And being the genius that he was, he then said, \"Well,\nhow do I... I don't know when to stop, but there's no... You know, everybody thinks\nwe should have stopped long before plants 'cause people made fun of him for that. And he's like,\n\"Yeah, but the science doesn't tell us where to stop. The tool is working, let's keep going.\"\nAnd he showed interesting phenomena on materials, metals, and other kinds\nof materials, right? And so- The interesting thing is that,\nyeah, there is no... there is no generic rule that tells\nyou when you need to stop. We make those up. Those are completely\nmade up. You have to just do the science and find out. - Yeah, we'll probably get to it.\nYou've been doing recent work on looking at computational systems,\neven trivial ones like algorithms, sorting algorithms... ...and analyzing them in a behavioral kind of\nway. See if there's minds inside those sorting inside those sorting algorithms.\nAnd, of course, let me make a pothead statement question\nhere that you could start to do things like trying to do\npsychedelics with a sorting algorithm. And what does that even look like? It looks like a ridiculous question\nthat'll get you fired from most academic departments, but it may be, if\nyou take it seriously, you could try ...and see if it applies. If a thing\ncould be shown to have some kind of cognitive complexity, some\nkind of mind, why not apply to it the same kind of\nanalysis and the same kind of tools, like psychedelics, that you\nwould to a complex human mind? At least, it might be a\nproductive question to ask. You've seen spiders on\npsychedelics, like more primitive biological organisms on\npsychedelics. Why not try to see what an algorithm does\non psychedelics? Anyway. - Well, the thing to remember is we don't have a magic sense or\nreally good intuition for what the mapping is between the\nembodiment of something and the degree of intelligence it has.\nWe think we do because we have an N of one example on Earth and\nwe know what to expect from cells, snakes to primates, but we really\ndon't. We don't have, and this is, we'll get into more of the stuff\non the platonic space, but our intuitions around that stuff is so\nbad that to really think that we know enough not to try things at this point\nis, I think, really shortsighted. - Before we talk about the platonic\nspace, let's lay out some foundations. I think one useful\none comes from the paper, A Technological Approach\nto Mind Everywhere. An experimentally grounded framework for\nunderstanding diverse bodies and minds. Could you tell me about this\nframework, and maybe can you tell me about Figure 1 from this paper\nthat has a few components? One is the tiers of biological\ncognition that goes from group to whole organism to whole tissue\norgan, down to neural network, down to\ncytoskeleton, down to genetic network, and then there's\nlayers of biological systems from ecosystem,\ndown to swarm, down to organism, tissue, and then finally cell. So, can you explain this figure\nand can you explain the TAME, - so-called, framework? So,\nthis is the version 1.0 and there's a kind of update, a 2.0\nthat I'm writing at the moment, trying to formalize in a careful\nway all the things that we've been talking about here, and in particular\nthis notion of having to do experiments to figure out\nwhere any given system is on a continuum. Let's just start with\nFigure 2 for a second, then we'll come back to Figure 1. First, just\nto unpack the acronym, I like the idea that it spells out TAME because\nthe central focus of this is interactions and how do\nyou interact with a system to have a productive interaction\nwith it? The idea is that cognitive claims are really protocol claims. When you\ntell me that something has some degree of intelligence, what you're really saying is, \"This\nis the set of tools I'm going to deploy and we can all find out how that\nworked out for you.\" And so, technological, because I wanted to\nbe clear with my colleagues that this was not a project in just\nphilosophy. This had very specific, empirical implications that\nare going to play out in engineering and regenerative medicine and so on. A\ntechnological approach to mind everywhere, this idea that we don't know yet where\ndifferent kinds of minds are to be found, and we have to empirically\nfigure that out. So, what you see here in figure two is basically this idea\nthat there is a spectrum, and I'm just showing four waypoints along that\nspectrum. As you move to the right of that spectrum, a couple things happen: persuadability\ngoes up, meaning that the systems become more reprogrammable, more plastic,\nmore able to do different things than whatever they're standardly doing. So, you\nhave more ability to get them to do new and interesting things. The effort\nneeded to exert influence goes down, that is, autonomy goes up.\nTo the extent that you are good at convincing or motivating the system to\ndo things, you don't have to sweat the details as much, right? This also has\nto do with what I call engineering agential materials. When you engineer\nwood, metal, plastic, things like that, you are responsible for absolutely\neverything because the material is not going to do anything other than hopefully\nhold its shape. If you're engineering active matter, or\nyou're engineering computational materials, or better yet, agential\nmaterials like living matter, you can do some very high-level prompting and let the system then do\nvery complicated things that you don't need to micromanage. We all know\nthat that increases when you're starting to work with intelligent\nsystems like animals and humans and so on. The other thing that goes down as\nyou get to the right is the amount of mechanism or physics that you\nneed to exert the influence goes down. So, if you know how\nyour thermostat is to be set as far as its set point, you really don't\nneed to know much of anything else, right? You just need to know that it is a homeostatic\nsystem and that this is how I change the set point. You don't need to know how the cooling and\nheating plant works in order to get it to do complex things. - By the way, a quick pause just for people who\nare listening: let me describe what's in the figure. There are four different\nsystems going up the scale of persuadability. The first system\nis a mechanical clock, then it's a thermostat, then it's a\ndog that gets rewards and punishments, Pavlov's dog,\nand then finally a bunch of very smart-looking humans communicating\nwith each other and arguing, persuading each other using reasons.\nThere are arrows below that showing persuadability going up as you go up these systems from the mechanical\nclock to a bunch of Greeks arguing, and then going down as the effort\nneeded to exert influence, and once again going down as mechanism knowledge\nneeded to exert that influence. - Yeah. I'll give you an example about\nthat, panel C here with the dog. Isn't it amazing that humans\nhave been training dogs and horses for thousands of years\nknowing zero neuroscience? amazing is that when I'm talking to you\nright now, I don't need to worry about manipulating all of the synaptic proteins in your\nbrain to make you understand what I'm saying and hopefully remember it. You're gonna do\nthat all on your own. I'm giving you very thin, in terms of information\ncontent, very thin prompts, and I'm counting on you as a\nmulti-scale agential material to take care of the chemistry\nunderneath, all right? - So you don't need a wrench to convince me? - Correct. I don't need, and I don't need physics to\nconvince you, and I don't need to know how you work. Like, I don't need to understand all of\nthe steps. What I do need to have is trust that you are a multi-scale cognitive\nsystem that already does that for yourself, and you do. This is an amazing thing.\nI know people don't think about this enough, I think. When you wake up in the\nmorning and you have social goals, research goals, financial goals,\nwhatever it is that you have, in order for you to act on those goals, sodium\nand calcium and other ions have to cross your muscle membranes. Those\nincredibly abstract goal states ultimately have to make the chemistry\ndance in a very particular way, right? Our entire body is a transducer of very abstract things.\nAnd by the way, not just our brains, but our organs have anatomical goals\nand other things that we can talk about, because all of this plays out in\nregeneration and development and so on. But the scaling, right, of all\nof these things, the way that you regulate yourself is not by, \"Oh my God,\" you\ndon't have to sit there and think, \"Wow, I really have to push some sodiums across\nthis membrane.\" All of that happens automatically, and that's\nthe incredible benefit of these multi-scale materials. So what I was\ntrying to do in this paper is a couple of things. All of these were, by the way,\ndrawn by Jeremy Gay, who's this amazing graphic artist that works with me. First of\nall, in panel A, which is the spiral I was trying to point out, is that at every\nlevel of biological organization, like we all know we're sort of nested\ndolls of organs and tissues and cells and molecules and whatever. But what I\nwas trying to point out is that this is not just structural. Every one of\nthose layers is competent and is doing problem-solving in different spaces,\nand spaces that are very hard for us to imagine. We humans are, because of our own\nevolutionary history, we are so obsessed with movement in three-dimensional\nspace. Even in AI you see this all the time. They say, \"Well, this\nthing doesn't have a robotic body, it's not embodied.\" Yeah, it's not\nembodied by moving around in 3D space, but biology has embodiments in all\nkinds of spaces that are hard for us to imagine, right? So your cells and\ntissues are moving in high-dimensional physiological state\nspaces, in gene expression state spaces, in anatomical\nstate spaces. They're doing that perception, decision-making,\naction loop that we do in 3D space when we think about robots wandering\naround your kitchen. They're doing those loops in these other spaces. And so the first\nthing I was trying to point out is that every layer of your body has its own\nability to solve problems in those spaces. And then on the right,\nwhat I was saying is that this distinction between, you know, people say,\n\"Well, there are living beings and then there are engineered machines,\" and then they often follow up with\nall the things machines are never gonna be able to do and whatever. And so what I was trying\nto point out here is that it is very difficult to maintain those kinds\nof distinctions, because life is incredibly interoperable.\nLife doesn't really care if the thing it's working with was evolved through random trial and error or was\nengineered with a higher degree of agency, because at every level within the\ncell, within the tissue, within the organism, within the collective,\nyou can replace and substitute engineered systems with\nnaturally evolved systems. And that question of, \"Is it real, is\nit biology or is it technology?\" I don't think is a useful question anymore. So\nI was trying to warm people up with this idea that what we're going to do now\nis talk about minds in general, regardless of their history or their composition.\nIt doesn't matter what you're made of. It doesn't matter how you got here. Let's talk\nabout what you're able to do and what your inner world looks like. That\nwas the goal of that. - Is it useful, as a thought\nexperiment, as an experiment of radical empathy, to try to\nput ourselves in the space of the different minds at each stage\nof the spiral? Like, what state space is human civilization as\na collective embodied? Like, what does it operate\nin? So humans, individual organisms, operate in 3D\nspace. That's what we understand. But when there's a bunch of\nus together, what are we doing together? - It's really hard, and you have to do experiments,\nwhich at larger scales are really difficult. - But there is such a thing? - There may well be. We have to do experiments.\nI don't know. Here's an example: Somebody will say to me, \"Well, you know, with\nyour kind of panpsychist view, you might as well think the weather is agential\ntoo.\" It's like, \"Well, I can't say that, but we don't know,\nbut have you ever tried to see if a hurricane has habituation or\nsensitization?\" Maybe. We haven't done the experiment. It's hard, but you could,\nright? And maybe weather systems can have certain kinds of memories. I have\nno idea. We have to do experiments. So I don't know what the entire human society is\ndoing, but I'll just give you a simple example of the kinds of tools, and we're\nactively trying to build tools now to enable radically different\nagents to communicate. So, we are doing this using\nAI and other tools to try and get this kind of communication\ngoing across very different spaces. I'll just give you a\nvery kind of dumb example of how that might be. Imagine that\nyou're playing tic-tac-toe against an alien, so you're in a\nroom. You don't see him. And so you draw the tic-tac-toe thing\non the board, on the floor. And you know what you're doing. You're trying\nto make straight lines with Xs and Os, and you're having a nice game. It's\nobvious that he understands the process. Like, sometimes you win, sometimes you lose.\nLike, it's obvious. In that one little segment of activity,\nyou guys are sharing a world. What's happening in the\nother room next door? Well, let's say the alien doesn't know anything about\ngeometry. He doesn't understand straight lines. What he's doing is\nhe's got a box, and it's full of basically billiard balls, each one of\nwhich has a number on it. And all he's doing is he's looking through the\nbox to find billiard balls whose numbers add up to 15. He\ndoesn't understand geometry at all. All he understands is arithmetic. You\ndon't think about arithmetic, you think geometry. The reason you guys are playing\nthe same game is that there's this magic square, right? that somebody constructed\nthat basically is a three-by-three square, where if you pick the numbers\nright, they add up to 15. He has no idea that there's a geometric\ninterpretation to this. He is solving the problem that\nhe sees, which is totally algebraic. You don't know anything about that. But\nif there is an appropriate interface like this magic square, you guys can share that\nexperience. You can have an experience. It doesn't mean you start to think like him. It means that\nyou guys are able to interact in a particular way. - Okay, so there's a mapping\nbetween the two different ways of seeing the world that allows\nyou to communicate with each other. - Of seeing a thin slice of the world. - Thin slice of the world. How do you\nfind that mapping? So you're saying we're trying to figure out ways\nof finding that mapping... ...for different kinds of systems.\nWhat's the process for doing that? - So, the process is\ntwofold. One is to get a better understanding of\nwhat the system... what space is the system navigating, what goals\ndoes it have, what level of ingenuity does it have to reach those goals. For example,\nxenobots, right? We make xenobots. This is... Or anthropods. These are biological\nsystems that have never existed on Earth before. We have no idea what\ntheir cognitive properties are. We're learning. We found some things. But\nyou can't predict that from first principles, because they're not at all what their\npast history would inform you of. - Can you actually explain briefly what\na xenobot is and what an anthropod is? - So one of the things that we've been doing\nis trying to create novel beings that have never been here before. The\nreason is that typically when you have a biological system,\nan animal or a plant, and you say, \"Hey, why does it have certain\nforms of behavior, certain forms of anatomy, certain forms of physiology?\nWhy does it have those?\" The answer is always the same. Well, there's\na history of evolutionary selection, and there's a long,\nlong history going back of adaptation, and there's certain environments,\nand this is what survived, and so that's why it has. So what I wanted to do was\nbreak out of that mold, and to basically force us as a community\nto dig deeper into where these things come from. And that means taking away the\ncrutch where you just say, \"Well, it's evolutionary selection that's... That's why it looks like\nthat.\" So in order to do that, we have to make artificial synthetic beings now.\nTo be clear, we are starting with living cells, so it's not that they\nhad no evolutionary history. The cells do. They had evolutionary history\nin frogs or humans or whatever. But the creatures they make and the capabilities that\nthese creatures have were never directly selected for. And in fact, they never existed.\nSo you can't tell the same kind of story. And what I mean is, we can take\nepithelial cells off of an early frog embryo, and you don't change\nthe DNA. No synthetic biology circuits, no material scaffolds,\nno nanomaterials, no weird drugs, none of that. What we're mostly\ndoing is liberating them from the instructive\ninfluences of the rest of the cells that they were in in their bodies. And\nso when you do that, normally these cells, are bullied by their neighboring cells\ninto having a very boring life. They become a two-dimensional outer covering\nfor the embryo, and they keep out the bacteria, and that's that. So you might ask, \"Well,\nwhat are these cells capable of when you take them away from that influence?\" So\nwhen you do that, they form another little life form we call\na xenobot. And it's this self-motile little thing that has cilia\ncovering its surface. The cilia are coordinated so they row against the water, and\nthen the thing starts to move, and has all kinds of amazing properties. It has different\ngene expression, so it has its own novel transcriptome. It's\nable to do things like kinematic self-replication, meaning make\ncopies of itself from loose cells that you put in its environment.\nIt has the ability to respond to sound, which normal embryos don't\ndo. It has these novel capacities. And we did that, and we said,\n\"Look, here are some amazing features of this novel system. Let's try to\nunderstand where they came from.\" And some people said, \"Well,\nmaybe it's a frog-specific thing, you know? Maybe this is just\nsomething unique to frog cells.\" And so we said, \"Okay, what's the furthest\nyou can get from frog embryonic cells? How about human adult cells?\"\nAnd so we took cells from adult human patients who were\ndonating tracheal epithelia for biopsies and things like that, and\nthose cells, again, no genetic change, nothing like that. They self-organized\ninto something we call anthropods. Again, self-motile little\ncreature. 9,000 different gene expressions. So about half\nthe genome is now different. And They have interesting abilities.\nFor example, they can heal human neural wounds. So in\nvitro, if you plate some neurons and you put a big scratch through it so you\ndamage them, anthropods can sit down, and they will, they will spontaneously, without us\nhaving to teach them to do it, they will spontaneously try to\nknit the neurons across. - What is this video that\nwe're looking at here? - So this is an anthropod. So often when I give\ntalks about this, I show people this video, and I say, \"What do you think this is?\" And\npeople will say, \"Well, it looks like some primitive organism you got from\nthe bottom of a pond somewhere.\" And I'll say, \"Well, what do you think the genome would\nlook like?\" And they say, \"Well, the genome would look like some primitive creature.\" Right? If\nyou sequence that thing, you'll get 100% Homo sapiens. And that doesn't look like any\nstage of normal human development. It doesn't act like any stage of human\ndevelopment. It has the ability to move around. It has, as I said,\nover 9,000 differential gene expressions. Also\ninterestingly, it is younger, than the cells that it comes from. So it\nactually has the ability to roll back its age, and we could talk about that and\nwhat the implications of that are. But to go back to your original question,\nwhat we're doing with these kind of systems ... - Trying to talk to it. - We're trying to talk to it. That's exactly right. And\nnot just to this. We're trying to talk to molecular networks. So, we found a couple years\nago, we found that gene regulatory networks, never mind the cells, but\nthe molecular pathways inside of cells can have several different kinds of\nlearning, including Pavlovian conditioning. And what we're doing now is trying to talk\nto it. The biomedical applications are obvious. Instead of, \"Hey, Siri,\" you\nwant, \"Hey, liver, why do I feel like crap today?\" And you want an answer. \"Well, you\nknow, your potassium levels are this and that, and I don't feel good for these\nreasons.\" And you should be able to talk to these things, and there\nshould be an interface that allows us to communicate, right? And I think\nAI is gonna be a huge component of that interface of allowing us to\ntalk to these systems. It's a tool to combat our mind blindness, to\nhelp us see diverse other... very unconventional minds\nthat are all around us. - Can you generalize that? So let's say\nwe meet an alien or an unconventional mind here on Earth. Think of it\nas a black box. You show up. What's the procedure for\ntrying to get some hooks into communication\nprotocol with the thing? - Yeah. That is exactly the\nmission of my lab. It is to enable us to develop tools to\nrecognize these things, to learn to communicate with them, to\nethically relate to them. And in general, to expand\nour ability to do this in the world around us. I specifically\nchose these kinds of things because they're not as alien as proper\naliens would be. So we have some hope. I mean, we're made of them. We have many things in\ncommon. There's some hope of understanding them. - You're talking about\nxenobots and anthropods? - Xenobots and anthropods and cells and everything\nelse. But they're alien in a couple of important ways. One is\nthe space they live in is very hard for us to imagine. What\nspace do they live in? Well, your body, your body cells, long\nbefore we had a brain that was good for navigating three-dimensional space,\nwas navigating the space of anatomical possibilities. It was going from,\nyou start as an egg, and you have to become, you know, a snake or\na giraffe or whatever, or a human, whatever we're gonna be. And I\nspecifically am telling you that specifically am telling you that this general idea when people model that\nwith cellular automata type of ideas, this open loop kind of thing where, well, everything just follows local rules and\neventually there's complexity, and here you go. Now, you've got a giraffe or a\nhuman. I'm specifically telling you that that model is totally insufficient\nto grasp what's actually going on. What's actually going on, and there have been\nmany experiments on this, is that the system is navigating a space. It is navigating\na space of anatomical possibilities. If you try to block where it's going,\nit will try to get around you. with things it's never seen before, it\nwill try to come up with a solution. If you really defeat its ability\nto do that, which you can. You know, they're not infinitely intelligent,\nso you can defeat them. You will either get birth defects or you will get\ncreative problem-solving such as what you're seeing here with xenobots and\nanthropods. If you can't be a human, you'll be you'll find another way to be in. You can\nbe an anthropod, for example, or you'll be something else. - Just to clarify, what's the difference\nbetween cellular automata type of action where you're just responding to\nyour local environment and creating some kind of complex behavior, and operating\nin the space of anatomical possibilities? - Sure. - So there's a kind of goal, I\nguess, you're articulating- - Yes. - There is some kind- - Yes - ... of thing. There's\na will to X something. - The will thing, let's put that aside- - Okay, sorry. - ...because that's a...\nWell, it's fine too. - There I go, anthropomorph- I just always\nlove to quote Nietzsche, so there we go. - Yeah. Yeah, yeah. And I'm not saying\nthat's wrong. I'm just saying I don't have data for that one, but I'll tell you\nthe stuff that I'm quite certain of. There are a couple of different formalisms\nthat we have in control theory. One of those formalisms is open-loop complexity. In\nother words, I've got a bunch of subunits, like a cellular automaton.\nThey follow certain rules, and you turn the crank, time goes forward,\nwhatever happens, happens. Clearly you can get complexity from this. Clearly you can get\nsome very interesting-looking things, right? So the game of life, all those kinds of\ncool things, right? You can get complexity. No, no, no problem. But\nthe idea that that model is going to be sufficient to explain and control things like\nmorphogenesis is a hypothesis. It's okay to make that hypothesis,\nbut we know it's false despite the fact that that is what\nwe learned, you know, in basic, uh, cell biology and developmental\nbiology classes. When the first time you see something like\nthis, inevitably, especially if you're an engineer in those classes, you go,\n\"Hey, how does it know to do that? How does it know, you know, four fingers\ninstead of seven?\" What they tell you is, \"It doesn't know anything.\" Make sure.\nThat's very clear. They all insist, like, when we learn these things, they\ninsist, \"Nothing here knows anything. There are rules of chemistry, they roll\nforward, and this is what happens.\" Okay. Now, that model is testable.\nWe can ask, \"Does that model explain what happens?\" Here's where that model\nfalls down. If you have that model and situations change, either\nthere's damage or something in the environment that's happened,\nthose kind of open-loop models do not adjust to give you the same goal by different means.\nThis is William James' definition of intelligence: the same goal by different\nmeans. And in particular, working them backwards, let's say you are in\nregenerative medicine and you say, \"Okay, but this is the situation now. I\nwant it to be different.\" What should the rules be? It's not reversible. So the thing with\nthose kind of open-loop models is they're not reversible. You don't know what to do to make the outcome that\nyou want. All you know how to do is roll them forward, right? Now, in biology, we\nsee the following: If you have a developmental system and\nyou put barriers between- So, I'm going to give you two pieces of\nevidence that suggest that there is a goal. One piece of evidence is that if\nyou try to block these things from the outcome that they normally\nhave, they will do some amazing things. Sometimes very\nclever things, sometimes not at all the way that they normally do it, right?\nSo this is William James' definition. By different means, by following different\ntrajectories, they will go around various local maxima and minima to get to where\nthey need to go. It is navigation of a space. It is not blind, turn the crank,\nand wherever we end up is where we end up. That is not what we see experimentally.\nAnd more importantly, I think, what we've shown, and\nthis is this is something that I'm particularly happy with in our lab,\nover the last 20 years, we've shown the following: We can actually rewrite the\ngoal states because we found them. We have shown through our work\non bioelectric imaging and bioelectric reprogramming, we have\nactually shown how those goal memories are encoded, at least in some cases. We\ncertainly haven't got them all, but we have some. If you can find where\nthe goal state is encoded, read it out, and reset it, and the system will now implement a new goal based\non what you just reset, that is the ultimate evidence that your goal directed model is working. Because if\nthere was no goal, that shouldn't be possible. Right? Once you\ncan find it, read it, interpret it, and rewrite\nit, it means that by any engineering standard, it means that you're\ndealing with a homeostatic mechanism. - How do you find where the goal's encoded? - So, through lots and lots of hard work. - The barrier thing is part of that?\nCreating barriers and observing? - The barrier thing tells you that\nyou should be looking for a goal. - So step one when you approach an agentic\nsystem is to create a barrier of different kinds until you see how\npersistent it is at pursuing the thing it seemed to\nhave been pursuing originally. And then you know, okay, cool, this\nis a... This thing has agency, first of all. And then second of all,\nyou start to build the intuition about exactly which goal it's pursuing. - Yes. The first couple of steps are all imagination.\nYou have to ask yourself, \"What space is this thing even working in?\" And you really have\nto stretch your mind, because we can't imagine all the spaces that systems work\nin, right? So, step one is, what space is it? Step two, what do I think the goal is?\nAnd let's not mistake step two, you're not done. Just because you have made a hypothesis, that\ndoesn't mean you can say, \"Well, there, I see it doing this, therefore that's the goal.\" You don't\nknow that. You have to actually do experiments. Now, once you've made those hypotheses, now you do the\nexperiments. You say, \"Okay, if I want to block it from reaching its goal, how do I do that?\" And\nthis, by the way, is exactly the approach we took with the sorting algorithms and with\neverything else. You hypothesize the goal, you put a barrier in, and then you\nget to find out what level of ingenuity it has. Maybe what you see is, \"Well,\nthat derailed everything, so probably this thing isn't very smart.\" Or you say, \"Oh, wow,\nit can go around and do these things.\" Or you might say, \"Wow, it's taking a\ncompletely different approach using its affordances in novel ways, like that's\na high level of intelligence.\" You will find out what the answer is. - Another pothead question: Is it\npossible to look at, speaking of unconventional organisms, and going to Richard Dawkins, for\nexample, with memes, is it possible to think of things like ideas? Like,\nhow weird can we get? Can we look at ideas as organisms, then\ncreating barriers for those ideas, and seeing if the ideas themselves...\nIf you take the individual ideas and trying to empathize\nand visualize what kind of space they might be operating in, can they\nbe seen as organisms that have a mind? - Yeah. Okay, if you want to get\nreally weird, we can get really weird here. Think about\nthe caterpillar-butterfly transition, okay? So, you've got a caterpillar,\na soft-bodied creature, which has a particular controller that's suitable\nfor running a soft body, you know, a robot. It has a brain for that task,\nand then it has to become this butterfly, a hard-bodied creature that\nflies around. Okay. During the process of metamorphosis, its brain\nis basically ripped up and rebuilt from scratch, right? Now,\nwhat's been found is that if you train the caterpillar, so you give it a new\nmemory, meaning that if the caterpillar sees this color disc, then it\ncrawls over and eats some leaves. Turns out, the butterfly\nretains that memory. Now, the obvious question is, how do you retain\nmemories when the medium is being refactored like that? Let's put that\naside. I'm going to get somewhere even weirder than that. There's something else\nthat's even more interesting than that. It's not just that you have to\nretain the memory. You have to remap that memory onto a\ncompletely new context, because guess what? The butterfly doesn't move the way\nthe caterpillar moves, and it doesn't care about leaves. It wants nectar from flowers.\nAnd so, if that memory is going to survive, it can't just persist. It has to- - be remapped. - ...be remapped into a novel context.\nNow, here's where things get weird. We can take a couple of different\nperspectives here. We can take the perspective of the caterpillar facing\nsome sort of crazy singularity and say, \"My God, I'm going to cease\nto exist, but, you know, I'll sort of be reborn in this new higher-dimensional\nworld where I'll fly.\" Okay, so that's one thing. We can\ntake the perspective of the butterfly and say that, \"Well, here\nI am, but, you know, I seem to be saddled with some tendencies and some\nmemories, and I don't know where the hell they came from, and I don't remember exactly\nhow I got them, and they seem to be a core part of my psychological\nmakeup, and, you know, they come from somewhere. I don't know where they come\nfrom.\" Right? So you can take that perspective. But there's a third perspective that I\nthink is really interesting and useful. The third perspective is out of the memory\nitself. If you take a perspective of the memory, What is a memory? It is a\npattern. It is an informational pattern that was continuously\nreinforced within one cognitive system, and\nnow here I am on this memory. What do I need to\ndo to persist into the future? Well, now I'm facing the\nparadox of change. If I try to remain the same, I'm gone. There's no way the\nbutterfly is going to retain me in the original form that I'm in now.\nWhat I need to do is change, adapt, and morph. Now, you might\nsay, \"Well, that's kind of crazy. How are you taking the perspective\nof a pattern within an excitable medium?\" Right? Agents are physical\nthings. You're talking about information, right? So let me tell you another quick science fiction\nstory. Imagine that some creatures come out from the center of the\nEarth. They live down in the core. They're super dense, okay? They're incredibly\ndense because they live down in the core. They have gamma ray vision\nfor... and so on. So they come out to the surface. What do\nthey see? Well, all of this stuff that we're seeing here, this is like a\nthin plasma to them. They are so dense. None of this is solid to them. They don't see any\nof this stuff. So they're walking around, you know, So they're walking around, you know, because the planet\nis, you know, covered in this thin gas, you know. covered in this, like, thin gas, you know. And\none of them is a scientist, and he's taking measurements of the gas, and he says to the others, \"You\nknow, I've been watching this gas, and there are, like, little whirlpools in this gas, and they almost look like\nagents. They almost look like they're doing things. They're moving around. They kind of hold themselves together\nfor a little bit, and they're trying to make stuff happen.\" and they're trying to make stuff happen.\"\nAnd the others say, \"Well, that's crazy. say, \"Well, that's crazy. Patterns in a gas\ncan't be agents. We're agents. We're solid. We're solid. This is just patterns in an excitable\nmedium. And by the way, how long do they hold together?\" He says, \"Well, about 100 years.\"\n\"Well, that's crazy. Nothing... Nothing... You know, no real agent\ncan exist to dissipate that fast. Okay. We are all metabolic patterns, among other\nthings, right? And so one of the things that... And so you see what I'm warming up to here. So\none of the things that we've been trying to dissolve, and this is some work that I've done with Chris Fields\nand others, is this distinction between thoughts and thinkers. distinction between thoughts and thinkers.\nSo, all agents are patterns within some excitable medium. We could talk about\nwhat that is, and they can spawn off others. and they can spawn off others. And now you\ncan have a really interesting spectrum. Here's the spectrum. You can have\nfleeting thoughts, which are like waves You can have fleeting thoughts, which are like\nwaves in the ocean when you throw a rock in. in the ocean when you throw a rock in. You know, they sort\nof go through the excitable medium and then they're gone. through the excitable medium and then they're\ngone. They pass through and they're gone, right? So those are kind of fleeting thoughts. Then you can have patterns\nthat have a degree of persistence, so they might be hurricanes, that have a degree of persistence, so they might be\nhurricanes or solitons or persistent thoughts or earworms persistent thoughts or earworms or depressive\nthoughts. Those are harder to get rid of. or depressive thoughts. Those are harder to get\nrid of. They stick around for a little while. They often do a little bit of niche construction, so they change the\nactual brain to make it easier to have more of those thoughts, right? so they change the actual brain to have- to make it easier to have more of\nthose thoughts, right? Like, that's a thing. And so they stay around longer. Like, that's a thing. And so they- they- they stay\naround longer. Now, what's further than that? Now, what's further than that? Well, fragments,\npersonality fragments of a dissociative Well, fragments, personality fragments of a\ndissociative personality disorder, they're more stable. personality disorder, they're more stable.\nAnd they're not just on autopilot. And they're not just on autopilot. They\nhave goals and they can do things. They have goals and they can do things. And then\npast that is a full-blown human personality. And who the hell knows what's past that? Maybe some sort of\ntrans-human, you know, transpersonal, like, I don't know, right? I don't know, right? But this idea, again,\nI'm back to this notion of a spectrum. It's there is not a sharp distinction between, you know,\nwe are real agents and then we have these thoughts. you know, we are real agents and then we have these- these-\nthese thoughts. Yeah, patterns can be agents too, but again, Yeah, patterns can be agents too, but again,\nyou don't know until you do the experiment. So, if you want to know whether a soliton or a hurricane\nor a thought within a cognitive system is its own agent, system is its own agent, do the\nexperiment. See what it can do. Does it- can it learn from experience? Does\nit have memories? Does it have goal states? Does it- Can it learn from experience? Does it have memories? Does it have\ngoal states? Does it, you know, what can it do, right? Does it have language? Does it have language? So, coming back to your original question,\nyeah, we can definitely apply this methodology to ideas and concepts yeah, we can definitely apply this methodology to ideas and concepts and\nsocial, uh, you know, whatevers, but you've got to do the experiment. and social, uh, you know, whatevers, but you've got to do the\nexperiment. That's such a challenging thought experiment of, like, - That's such a challenging thought experiment of, like, thinking about\nmemories, from the caterpillar to the butterfly as an organism. thinking about memories, from the caterpillar to the butterfly as an organism. I\nthink at the very basic level, intuitively, we think of organisms as hardware. I think at the very basic level, intuitively,\nwe think of organisms as hardware. ... and software as not possibly\nbeing able to be organisms, but- ... what you're saying is that\nit's all just patterns in an excitable medium, and it\ndoesn't really matter what the pattern is. We\nneed to... and what the excitable medium is. We need\nto do the testing of what, how persistent is it? How goal oriented is it? And there are certain kind of\ntests to do that, and you can apply that to memories. You can apply\nthat to ideas. You can apply that to anything, really. I mean, you\ncould probably think about, like, consciousness. You\ncould... there's really no boundary to what you can imagine.\nProbably really, really wild things could be minds. - Yeah. Stay tuned. I mean, this is exactly what\nwe're doing. We're getting progressively, like, more and more unconventional.\nI mean, so this whole distinction between software and hardware,\nI think it's a super important, concept to think about. And yet, the way we've mapped it\nonto the world, I would like to blow that up in the following\nway. And again, I want to point out what the practical consequences are because this is not\njust, you know, fun stories that we tell each other. These have\nreally important research implications. Think about a Turing\nmachine. So one thing you can say is the machine's the agent.\nIt has passive data, and it operates on the data, and that's it. The\nstory of agency is the story of whatever that machine can and can't do. The data is passive,\nand it moves it around. You can tell the opposite story. You can say, \"Look, the patterns on\nthe data are the agent. The machine is a stigmergic scratch pad in the\nworld of the data doing what data does.\" The machine is just the consequences,\nthe scratch pad of it working itself out. And both of those stories make sense\ndepending on what you're trying to do. Here's the biomedical side of things. So our\nprogram in bioelectrics and aging, okay? One model you could have is the\nphysical organism is the agent and the cellular collective has pattern memories, specifically what I was\nsaying before, goals, anatomical goals. If you want to persist for 100\nplus years, your cells better remember what your correct shape is and\nwhere the new cells go, right? So there are these pattern memories. They exist\nduring embryogenesis, during regeneration, during resistance to aging. We can\nsee them. We can visualize them. One thing you can imagine is, fine, the\nphysical body, the cells, are the agent. The electrical\npattern memories are just data, and what might happen during\naging is that the data might get degraded. They might get fuzzy. And\nso what we need to do is reinforce the memories, reinforce the pattern memories.\nThat's one specific research program, and we're doing that. But\nthat's not the only research program because the other thing\nyou might imagine is that, what if the patterns are the\nagent in exactly the same sense as we think in our brains? It's\nthe patterns of electrophysiological, computations, whatever else,\nthat is the agent, right? And that what they're doing in the brain\nare the side effects of the patterns working themselves out. And those side effects\nmight be to fire off some muscles, glands, and other things. From that\nperspective, maybe what's actually happening is, maybe the agent's finding it\nharder and harder to be embodied in the physical world. Why? Because\nthe cells might get less responsive. In other words,\nthe cells are sluggish. The patterns are fine. They're having a harder\ntime making the cells do what they need to do, and maybe what you need to do is not\nreinforce the memories. Maybe what you need to do is make the cells more responsive\nto them, and that is a different research agenda, which we are also doing. We have\nevidence for that as well, actually now. We published it recently. So\nmy point here is, when we tell these crazy sci-fi stories, the only worth\nto them, and the only reason I'm talking about them now, and a year ago I wasn't\ntalking about this stuff, is because these are now actionable in terms of specific experimental\nresearch agendas that are heading to the clinic, I hope, in some of\nthese biomedical approaches. So now here we can go beyond\nthis and say, \"Okay, up until now we've considered,\nwhat are disease states?\" Well, we know there's organic disease, something\nthat's physically broken. We can see the tissues breaking down. There's damage in\nthe joint, you know, where the liver is doing what, you know, we can see\nthese things. But what about disease states that are not\nphysical states? They're physiological states,\ninformational states, or cognitive problems? So in all of these\nother spaces, you can start to ask, what's a barrier in gene\nexpression space? What's a local minimum that traps you in\nphysiological state space? And what is a stress pattern that keeps itself\ntogether, moves around the body, causes damage, tries to keep itself\ngoing, right? What level of agency does it have? This\nsuggests an entirely different set of approaches to biomedicine.\nAnd, you know, anybody who's, let's say, in the\nalternative medicine community is probably yelling at the screen right now\nsaying, \"We've been saying this for hundreds of years.\" And yeah, I'm\nwell aware these are not the ideas are not new. What's new is\nbeing able to now take this and make them actionable and say, \"Yeah, but we can\nimage this now. I can now actually see the bioelectric patterns and why they go here\nand not there.\" And we have the tools that now hopefully will get\nus to therapeutics. So this is very actionable stuff,\nand it all leans on not assuming we know minds when we see\nthem, because we don't, and we have to do experiments. - To return back to the software-hardware\ndistinction, you're saying that we can see the\nsoftware is the organism and the hardware is just the scratch pad, or you could see the hardware as the\norganism and the software is the thing that the hardware generates,\nand in so doing, we can decrease the amount of\nimportance we assign to something like the human brain, or it\ncould be the activations, it could be the electrical signals that are the\norganisms, and then the brain is the scratch pad. - And by saying scratch pad, I don't mean\nit's not important. When we get to talking Platonic space, we have to talk about\nhow important the interface actually is. The scratchpad isn't unimportant;\nthe scratchpad is critical. It's just that my only point\nis that when we have these formalisms of software, of hardware,\nof other things, the way we map those formalisms onto the world is not\nobvious. It's not given to us. We get used to certain things, right?\nBut who's the hardware, who's the software, who's the agent and who's the\nexcitable medium is is to be determined. - So this is a good place to\ntalk about the increasingly radical, weird ideas that you've been\nwriting about. You've mentioned it a few times: the Platonic space. So there's this Ingressing Minds paper\nwhere you described the Platonic space. You mentioned there's\nan asynchronous conference happening, which is a\nfascinating concept because it's asynchronous. People are just\ncontributing asynchronously. - So what happened was this crazy notion,\nwhich I'll describe momentarily. I have given a couple talks on it. I then\nfound a couple papers in the machine learning community called\nthe Platonic Representation Hypothesis, and I said, \"That's pretty\ncool. These guys are climbing up to the same point where I'm getting at it from\nbiology and philosophy and whatever. They're getting there from computer science and\nmachine learning.\" We'll take a couple hours, I'll give a talk, they'll give a talk,\nwe'll talk about it. I thought there were going to be three talks at this thing.\nOnce I started reaching out to people for this, everybody sort of\nsaid, \"You know, I know somebody who's really into this stuff, but\nthey never talk about it because there's no audience for this.\" So I reached out to them.\nAnd then they said, \"Yeah. Oh, yeah, I know this mathematician,\" or, \"I know this, you\nknow, economist, whatever, who has these ideas and there's nowhere we can have her talk\nabout them.\" So I got this whole list and it became completely obvious that we\ncan't do this in a normal... it's... We are now booked up through\nDecember. So every week in our center, somebody gives a talk. We kind of\ndiscuss it. It all goes on this thing. I'll give you a link to it, and then\nthere's a huge running discussion after that, and then in the end, we're all\ngoing to get together for an actual real-time discussion section and talk about it.\nBut there's going to be probably 15 or so talks about this from all\nkinds of disciplines. It's blown up in a way that I\ndidn't realize how much undercurrent of these ideas had already existed that were ready, like now\nis the time. And I think... this is... like, I've been thinking about these\nthings for, I don't know, 30-plus years. I never talked about them before\nbecause they weren't actionable before. There wasn't a way to actually\nmake empirical progress with this now. You know, this is something that\nPythagoras and Plato and probably many people before them talked about,\nbut now we're to the point where we can actually do experiments,\nand they're making a difference in our research program. - You can just look it up: Platonic Space Conference. There's a bunch\nof different fascinating talks. Yours first on The Patterns of\nForms and Behavior, Beyond Emergence, then Radical Platonism and\nRadical Empiricism from Joel Dietz, and Patterns and Explanatory\nGaps In Psychotherapy, Does God Play Dice? from Alexey Tolchinsky, and so\non. So, let's talk about it. What is it? And it's fascinating that\nthe origins of some of these ideas are connected to ML people thinking\nabout representation space. representation space. - Yeah. The first thing I want to say\nis that while I'm currently calling it the Platonic space, I am in no way trying to stick close to\nthe things that Plato actually thought about. In fact, to whatever extent we even know\nwhat that is, I think I depart from that in quite... In some ways, and I'm going to\nhave to change the name at some point. The reason I'm using the name now is\nbecause I wanted to be clear about a particular connection to mathematics,\nwhich a lot of mathematicians would call themselves Platonists because\nwhat they think they're doing is discovering... Not inventing as a human\nconstruction, but discovering a structured ordered space of truths. Let's put it\nthis way: In biology, as in physics, there's something very curious that\nhappens that if you keep asking why, you keep asking why, then something interesting goes on.\nLet's... Well, I'll give you two examples. First of all, imagine cicadas. The cicadas\ncome out at 13 years and 17 years, okay? And so if you're a biologist\nand you say, \"So why is that?\" Then you get this explanation for, \"Well,\nit's because they're trying to be off-cycle from their predators. Because if it was 12\nyears, then every two year, every three year, every four year, every six year, a predator\nwould eat you when you come out, right? So you say, \"Okay, cool. That makes\nsense. What's special about 13 and 17?\" \"Oh, they're prime.\" \"Uh-huh. And why are they\nprime?\" Well, now you're in the math department. You're no longer in the biology department.\nYou're no longer in the physics department. You're now in the math department to\nunderstand why the distribution of primes is what it is. Another example, and I'm\nnot a physicist, but what I see is every time you talk to a physicist and\nyou say, \"Hey, why do the, you know, leptons do this or that, or the\nfermions are doing whatever?\" Eventually, the answer is, \"Oh, because\nthere's this mathematical, you know, this SU(8) group or whatever the heck it is,\nand it has certain symmetries in these certain structures.\" \"Yeah, great. Once again,\nyou're in the math department.\" So something interesting happens is that\nthere are facts that you come across, many of them are very surprising. You don't\nget to design them. You get more out than you put in, in a certain way, because\nyou make very minimal assumptions. And then certain facts are thrust upon you. For\nexample, the value of Feigenbaum's constant, the value of natural logarithm E. These\nthings you sort of discover, right? These things you sort of discover, right? And the salient fact is this:\nif those facts were different, different, then biology and\nphysics would be different, right? They impact instructively, functionally;\nthey impact the physical world. impact the physical world. If the distribution of\nprimes was something else, well then the cicadas would have been coming out at different times.\nBut the reverse isn't true. What I mean is, there is nothing you can do in the\nphysical world to change E, as far as I know, to change E or to change\nFeigenbaum's constant. You could have swapped out all the constants at the Big Bang,\nright? You can change all the different things, you are not going to change those\nthings. So- so this, I think Plato and Pythagoras understood\nvery clearly, that there is a set of truths which impact\nthe physical world, but they themselves are not\ndefined by and determined by what happens in the physical world. You can't change\nthem by things you do in the physical world, right? And so I'll make a couple claims about\nthat. One claim is, I think we call physics those things that are constrained\nby those patterns. When you say, \"Hey, why is this the way it is?\" Ah, it's\nbecause this is how symmetry, symmetries or topology or whatever.\nBiology are the things that are enabled by those. They're free\nlunches. Biology exploits these kinds of truths. And and\nreally it enables biology and evolution to do amazing things without having to\npay for it. I think there's a lot of free lunches going on here. And so I\nshow you a xenobot or an anthropod, and I say, \"Hey, look,\nhere are some amazing things they're doing,\" that tissue has never\ndone before in their history. You say, first of all, where did\nthat come from? And when did we pay the computational cost for it? Because\nwe know when we pay the computational cost to design a frog or a human, it was\nfor the eons that the genome was bashing against the environment getting selected, right?\nSo you pay the computational cost of that. There's never been any anthropods. There's never been\nany xenobots. When do we pay the computational cost for designing kinematic self-replication and,\nyou know, all these things that they're able to do? So there's two\nthings people say. One is, \"Well, it's sort of ... You\ngot it at the same time that they were being selected to be good humans\nand good frogs.\" Now, the problem with that is it kind of undermines the point of\nevolution. The point of evolutionary theory was to have a very tight\nspecificity between what ... How you are now and the history of selection that got you here,\nright? The history of environments that got you to this point. If you say, \"Yeah, okay, so\nthis is what your environmental history was. And by the way, you got something\ncompletely different. You got these other skills that you didn't know about,\" that- that's\nreally strange, right? And so then what people say is, \"Well, it's emergent.\" And I say,\n\"What's that? What does that mean?\" And they say ... Besides the fact that you got surprised,\nright? Emergence is often just means I didn't see it coming. You know, there was something happened.\nI- I didn't know that was going to happen. So so what does it mean that it's emergent?\nAnd people say, \"Well,\" and there are many emergent things like this. For example,\nthe fact that gene regulatory networks can do associative learning. Like, that's amazing,\nand you don't need evolution for that. Even random genetic regulatory networks\ncan do associative learning. I say, \"Why- why- why does that happen?\" And they say, \"Well,\nit's just a fact that holds in the world. Just a fact that holds.\" So- so\nnow you have a ... You have an option, and you can go one of two\nways. You can either say, \"Okay, look, I like my sparse ontology. I don't want to\nthink about weird platonic spaces. I'm a physicalist. I want the physical world, nothing\nmore.\" So what we're going to do is when we come across these crazy things that are very\nspecific, like, you know, anthropods have four specific behaviors that they switch\naround. Why- why four? Why not 12? Why not 100? Like four, why four? When we come across these\nthings, just like when we come across the value of E or Feigenbaum's number or whatever,\nwhat we're going to do is we're going to write it down in our big book of emergence. And that's\nit. We're just going to have to live with it. This is what happens. We're just... You know, there's some cool surprises. When we come\nacross them, we're going to write them down. Great. It's a random grab bag of stuff. And when\nwe come across them, we'll write them down. That's one. The upside is you get\nto be a physicalist, and you get to keep your, your sparse ontology.\nThe downside is I find it incredibly pessimistic\nand mysterian because you're basically then just\nwilling to make a catalog of these, of these amazing patterns.\nWhy not, instead, and this is why I started with this\nPlatonic terminology, why not do what the\nmathematicians already do? A huge number of them say,\n\"We are gonna make the same optimistic assumption that science makes, that\nthere's an underlying structure to that latent space. It's not a random grab\nbag of stuff. There's a space to it which, where these patterns come\nfrom, and by studying them systematically, we can get from one to another. We can map\nout the space. We can, we can find out the relationships between them. We can get an idea\nof what's in that space, and we're not going to assume that it's just random. We're gonna\nassume there's some kind of structure to it. And you'll see all kinds of people, I mean, you know,\nwell-known mathematicians that talk about this stuff. You know, Penrose and lots of other people who\nwill say that, \"Yeah, there's another space physically, and it has spatial structure.\nIt has components to it and so on. We can traverse that space in various\nways.\" Uh, and then, and then there's the physical space. So I, I\nfind, I find that much more, Appealing because it suggests\na research program, which we are now undergoing in our lab. The research\nprogram is everything that we make, cells, embryos, robots, biobots, language models, simple machines,\nall of it, they are interfaces. All physical\nthings are interfaces to these patterns. You build an interface, some of\nthose patterns are going to come through that interface. Depending on what you build,\nsome patterns versus others are going to come through. The research program\nis mapping out that relationship between the physical pointers that we make,\nand the patterns that come through it, right? Understanding the structure of that\nspace, what exists in that space, and what do I need to make physically to make certain\npatterns come through? Now, when I say patterns, now we have to ask, \"What kinds of things\nlive in that space?\" Well, the mathematicians will tell you, \"Well, we already know. We have a whole\nlist of objects. You know, the amplituhedrons and all this crazy stuff that lives in\nthat space.\" Yeah, I think that's one layer of stuff that lives in\nthat space, but I think those patterns are the lower\nagency kinds of things that are basically studied by\nmathematicians. What also lives in that space are much\nmore active, more complex, higher agency patterns that we\nrecognize as kinds of minds, that behavioral scientists would look at that\npattern and say, \"Well, I know what that is. That's the competency for delayed gratification\nor problem-solving of certain kinds,\" or whatever. And so, so what I end\nup with right now is a model in which that latent space contains\nthings that come through physical objects, so simple, simple patterns,\nright? So, so facts about triangles and, and Fibonacci, you know,\npatterns and fractals and things like that. But also, if you make\nmore complex interfaces such as biologicals and, and, but, but importantly,\nnot just biologicals, but let's say cells and embryos and tissues, what\nyou will then pull down is much more complex patterns that we say, \"Ah,\nthat's a mind. That's a human mind,\" or, \"That's a, you know,\nsnake mind,\" or whatever. So I I think the mind-brain relationship is exactly\nthe kind of thing that the math-physics relationship is, that in some very\ninteresting way, there are truths of mathematics that become\nembodied, and they kind of haunt physical objects, right, in a\nvery specific functional way. And in the exact same way, there are\nother patterns that are much more complex, higher agency\npatterns that basically inform living things that we\nsee as obvious embodied minds. - Okay, given how weird and complicated\nwhat you're describing is, we'll talk about it more, but you gotta\nELI5 the basics to a person who's never seen this. So again, you You mentioned things like\npointers. So the physical object itself or the brain is a pointer to that Platonic space. What is in\nthat Platonic space? What is the Platonic space? What is the\nembodiment? What is the pointer? - Yeah, okay. Let's try it this way. There\nare certain facts of mathematics. So the distribution of prime numbers, right? If you\nmap them out, they make these nice spirals. And there's an image that I often show,\nwhich is a very particular kind of fractal. And that fractal is the Hally\nmap, which is pretty awesome that it actually looks very organic. It looks\nvery biological. So if you look at that thing, that image, which\nhas very specific complex structure, it's a map of a\nvery compact mathematical object. That formula is like, you know,\nZ cubed plus seven. It's something like that. That's it. So now you look\nat that structure and you say, \"Where does that actually come from?\" It's\ndefinitely not packed into the Z cubed plus seven. It's not, there's not enough\nbits in that to give you all of that. There's no fact of physics that determines\nthis. There's no evolutionary history. It's not like we selected this based on\nsome, you know, from a larger set over time. Where does this come\nfrom? Or, or the fact that... Think about the way that\nbiology exploits these things. Imagine a world in which the\nhighest fitness belonged to a certain kind of triangle, right? So evolution cranks a bunch of generations and it gets\nthe first angle right, then cranks a bunch more generations, gets a second angle right. Now,\nthere's something amazing that happens. Doesn't need to look for the third angle because you\nalready know. If you know two, you get this magical free gift from geometry that says, \"Well, I already know what\nthe third one should be.\" You don't have to go look for it. Or as evolution, if you invent a\nvoltage-gated ion channel, which is basically a transistor, right, and you\ncan make a logic gate, then all the truth tables and the fact that NAND is\nspecial and all these other things, you don't have to evolve those things. You get\nthose for free. You inherit those. Where do all those things live? These mathematical truths\nthat you come across that you don't have any choice about. You know, once you've\ncommitted to certain axioms, there's a whole bunch of other stuff\nthat is now just it is what it is. And so what I'm saying is,\nand this is what, what, what Pythagoras was saying, I think, that\nthere is a whole space of these kinds of truths. Now, he was focused\non mathematical ones, but he was embodying them in music and in geometry\nand in things like that. There are the space of patterns, and\nthey make a difference in the physical world, to machines, to\nsound, to things like that. I'm extending it, and what I'm saying\nis, yeah, and so far we've only been looking at the low\nagency inhabitants of that... world. There are other patterns\nthat we would recognize as kinds of minds, and that you don't\nsee them in this space until there's an interface, until there's a way\nfor them to come through the physical world. That interface, the same way that\nyou have to make a triangular object before you can actually see the rule\nof what you're going to gain, right? Out of the rules of geometry and\nwhatever. Or you have to actually do the computation on the fractal before\nyou actually see that pattern. If you want to see some of those\nminds, you have to build an interface, at least if you're going to interact with them in\nthe physical world, the way we normally do science. As Darwin said, \"Mathematicians have their own new\nsense, like a different sense than the rest of us.\" So that's right. You know,\nmathematicians can perhaps interact with these patterns directly in\nthat space. But for the rest of us, we have to make interfaces.\nAnd when we make interfaces, which might be cells, robots,\nembryos, or whatever, what we are pulling down are minds\nthat are fundamentally not produced by physics. So I don't believe that, I don't know\nif we're going to get into the whole consciousness thing, but I don't believe that we create\nconsciousness, whether we make babies or whether we make robots. Nobody's\ncreating consciousness. What you create is a physical interface through which specific patterns, which we call\nkinds of minds, are going to ingress, right? And consciousness\nis what it looks like from that direction looking out into the world.\nIt's what we call the view from the perspective of the Platonic patterns. - Just to clarify, what you're saying\nis a pretty radical idea here. if there's a mapping from mathematics to physics, okay, that's\nunderstandable, intuitive, as you've described. But what you're suggesting is there's a mapping from some\nkind of abstract mind object to an embodied brain that\nwe think of as a mind— as fellow humans. What is that?\nWhat exactly? You said interface. You've also said pointer. So\nthe brain, and I think you said somewhere a thin interface. - A thin client. Yeah. The brain— - Thin client. - The brain, a brain is a thin client. Yeah. - Thin client. Okay. So you're... A brain\nis a thin client to this other world. Can you just lay out very\nclearly how radical the idea is? - Sure. - Because you're kind of dancing\naround. I think you could also point to Donald Hoffman, who\nspeaks of an interface to a world. So we only interact with\nthe \"real world\" through an interface. What is the connection here? - Yeah. Okay, a couple of things.\nFirst of all, when you said it makes sense for physics, I want to show\nthat it's not as simple as it sounds. Because what it means is\nthat even in Newton's boring, classical universe,\nlong before quantum anything, Newton's world, physicalism was\nalready dead. In Newton's world, I mean, think about what that\nmeans. This is nuts, because already he knew perfectly well, I\nmean Pythagoras and Plato knew, that even in a totally classical,\ndeterministic world, already you have the\ningression of information that determines what happens and what's\npossible and what's not possible in that world from a space that is itself not\nphysical. In other words, it's something like the natural logarithm E, right?\nNothing in Newton's world is set to the value of E. There is nothing you could\ndo to set the value of E in that world. And yet that fact that it was that and\nnot something else governed all sorts of properties of things that\nhappened. That classical world was already haunted by patterns\nfrom outside that world. This, this should be like... This is,\nthis is, this is wild. This is not saying that, \"Okay, everything was\ncool. Physicalism was great up until, you know, maybe we got\nquantum this, interfaces, or we got, you know, consciousness or whatever. But originally\nit was fine.\" No, this is saying that it was... That worldview\nwas already impossible really since... So from\na very long time ago, we already knew that there are non-physical\nproperties that matter in the physical world. - This is the chicken or the egg question.\nYou're saying Newton's laws are creating the physical world? - That is a very deep\nfollow-on question that I... we'll come back to in a minute.\nAll I was saying about Newton is that you don't need quantum\nanything. You don't need to think about consciousness. You already,\nlong before you get to any of that, as Pythagoras, I think, knew, already we have\nthe idea that this physical world is being strongly impacted by truths that do not\nlive in the physical world. And when I say- - Wait. Which truths are we referring to? Are we\ntalking about Newton's laws, like mathematical equations or? - No. Mathematical facts. So for\nexample, the actual value of E or- - Oh, like very primitive\nmathematical facts. - Yeah, yeah. I mean, some of them are, you know...\nI mean, if you ask Don Hoffman, there's this like, amplituhedron thing that is a set\nof mathematical objects that determines all the scattering amplitudes of the particles\nand whatever. They don't have to be simple. I mean, the old ones were simple. Now\nthey're like crazy. I can't imagine this amplituhedron thing, but maybe\nthey can. But all of these are mathematical structures\nthat explain and determine facts about the physical world, right? If you ask\nphysicists, \"Hey, why this many of this type of particle?\" \"Ah, because this mathematical\nthing has these symmetries.\" That's why. - So Newton is discovering these\nthings. He's not inventing. - This is very controversial, right? And there are\nof course physicists and mathematicians who, who disagree with what\nI'm saying, for sure. But what I'm leaning on is simply\nthis. I don't know of anything you can do in the physical world. At the big...\nYou're around at the Big Bang, you get to set all the constants. Change set physics however you\nwant. Can you change E? Can you change Feigenbaum's constant?\nI don't think you can. - Is that an obvious statement? I don't\neven know what it means to change the parameters at the start of the Big Bang. - So physicists do this. They'll say,\n\"Okay, you know, if we made the the ratio between the, you\nknow, the gravitation and, would we have matter? Would we... How many dimensions would we have? Would there\nbe inflation? Would there be this or that?\" Right? You can imagine playing\nwith it. There are however many unitless constants of physics. These\nare the kind of like knobs on the universe that could, in\ntheory, be different, and then you'd have different physics, you'd\nhave different physical properties. - You're saying that's not going to change\nthe axiomatic systems that mathematics has? - What I'm not saying is that every alien\neverywhere is going to have the exact same math that we have. That's not what I'm claiming.\nAlthough, maybe. But that's not what I'm claiming. What I'm saying is, you get more out\nthan you put in. Once you've made a choice... And maybe some alien somewhere made a\ndifferent choice of how they're going to do their math. But once you've made your choice, then\nyou get saddled with a whole bunch of new truths that you discover that you can't\ndo anything about. They are given to you from somewhere. And you can say they're\nrandom, or you can say, \"No, there's this space of these facts that they're pulled from.\nThere's a latent space of options that they come from.\" So when you get... So when\nyour E is exactly 2.718 and so on, there is nothing you can\ndo in physics to change it. - And you're saying that\nspace is immutable? It's- - I'm not saying it's immutable. So I\nthink Plato may or may not have thought that these forms are eternal and unchanging.\nThat's one place we differ. I actually think that space has some action to it,\nmaybe even some computation to it. - But we're, we're just pointers. Can this- - Well, so let's... Okay, so I'll circle, I'll\ncircle back around to that whole thing. So the only thing I was trying to do is\nblow up the idea that we're cool with how it works in physics. No problem\nthere. I don't... I think that's a much bigger deal than people normally\nthink it is. I think already there, you have this weird\nhaunting of the physical world by patterns that are not coming\nfrom the physical world. The reason I emphasize this is because\nnow what I'm going to... when I amplify this into biology, I don't\nthink it sort of jumps as a new thing. I think it's just a much\nmore... I think what we call biology is our systems that exploit the hell\nout of it. I think physics is so constrained by it, but we call\nbiology those things that make use of those kinds of things\nand run with it. And so I, again, I just think it's a scaling. I don't think it's a\nbrand new thing that happens. I think it's a scaling, right? So what I'm saying is we already know from physics\nthat there are non-physical patterns, and these are generally patterns\nof form, which is why I call them low agency, because they're like fractals that\nstand still, and they're like prime number distributions. Although there's a mathematician\nthat's talking in our symposium that's telling me that actually I'm too chauvinistic\neven there. That actually, even those things have more oomph than even I gave\n'em credit for, which I love. So what I'm saying is those kind of static patterns are things that we\ntypically see in physics, but they're not the full extent of what\nlives in that space. That space is also home to some patterns that are\nvery high agency. And if we give them a body, if we build a body that\nthey can inhabit, then we get to see different behavioral competencies that\nthe behavior scientists say, \"Oh, I know what that looks like.\" That's this kind of behavioral\nyou know... This kind of mind or that kind of mind. In a certain\nsense, I mean, yes, what I'm saying is extremely radical, but it is a very old idea. It's an old\nidea of a dualistic world view, right? Where the mind\nwas not in the physical body, and that it in some way\ninteracted with the physical brain. So, I just want to be clear. I'm not\nclaiming that this is fundamentally a new idea. This has been around forever.\nHowever, it's mostly been discredited, and it's\na very unpopular view nowadays. There are very few people in, for\nexample, the cognitive science community or anywhere else in science that like this kind\nof view. Primarily, and already Descartes was getting crap for this when he\nfirst tried it out as this interaction problem, right? So the idea was, okay,\nwell, if you have this non-physical mind, and then you have this brain that presumably obeys\nconservation of mass energy and things like that, how are you supposed to interact with it?\nAnd there are many other problems there. So what I'm trying to\npoint out is that, first of all, physics already had this problem. You didn't\nhave to wait until you had biology and cognitive science to ask about it. And\nwhat I think is happening and the way, the, the way we need\nto think about this is coming back to my point that I\nthink the mind-brain relationship is basically of the same\nkind as the math-physics relationship. The same way that\nnon-physical facts of physics haunt physical objects is basically\nhow I think different kinds of patterns that we\ncall kinds of minds are manifesting through our...\nthrough interfaces like brains. - How do we prove or disprove\nthe existence of that world? 'Cause it's a pretty radical one. Because this physical world, we can\npoke. It's there. It feels like all the incredible things like consciousness\nand cognition and all the goal-oriented behavior and agency all\nseems to come from this 3D entity. - Yeah, I mean... - And so like, we can test it. We can\npoke it. We can hit it with a stick. - Yeah, sort of. - Makes noises. - Sort of. I mean, so Descartes\ngot some stuff wrong, I think. But one thing that he did get right, the\nfact that you actually, you don't know what you can poke and what you can't poke. The only\nthing you actually know are the contents of your mind, and everything else might be... And in fact, what we know from Anil\nSeth and Don Hoffman and various other people, it's definitely a construct. You\nmight be on drugs, and you might wake up tomorrow and say, \"My God, I had the\ncraziest dream of being Lex Fridman.\" Amazing. - It's a nightmare. - Yeah, well... Yeah,\nthat... Who knows? But- - It's a ride. - Right? But you see, I... You know, it's not clear at all that the\nphysical poking is your primary reality. That's not clear to me at all. - I don't know. That's an obvious\nthing that a lot of people can show is true. To take a step to Descartes, \"I think, therefore I am.\" That's the only thing you\nknow for sure and everything else could be an illusion or a dream. That's already a leap. I think from a basic caveman science\nperspective, the repeatable experiment is the one that most of intelligence\ncomes from here. The reality's exactly as it is. To take\na step towards the Donald Hoffman worldview takes a\nlot of guts and imagination, and stripping away of the ego and\nall these kinds of processes. - I think you can get there more\neasily by synthetic bioengineering in the following sense. Do\nyou feel a lack of x-ray perception? Do you feel blind\nin the x-ray spectrum or in the ultraviolet? I mean, you don't. You\nhave absolutely no clue that stuff is there, and all of your reality\nas you see it is shaped by your evolutionary history. It's shaped by the\ncognitive structure that you have, right? There are tons of stuff going on around\nus right now that we, of which we are completely oblivious. There's equally\nall kinds of other stuff which we construct, and this is just modern\ncognitive science that says that a lot of what we think is going on is\na total fabrication constructed by us. So, I think this is not... I don't\nthink this is a philo... I mean, Descartes got there from a philosophical point.\nThat's not what I'm, that's not the leap I'm asking us to make. I'm saying that depending\non your embodiment, depending on your interface, and this is increasingly gonna be more relevant as we make\nfirst augmented humans that have sensory substitution. You're gonna be walking\naround. Your friend's gonna be like, \"Oh, man, I have this primary perception of the solar\nweather and the stock market because I got those implants.\" \"And what do you see?\" \"Well, I see\nthe, you know, the traffic or the internet through the, you know, Trans-Pacific Channel.\" We're\nall gonna be living in somewhat different worlds. That's the first thing. The\nsecond thing is we're gonna become better attuned to other beings, whether they be cells, tissues. You know, what's\nit like to be a cell living in a 20,000-dimensional\ntranscriptional space, okay? To novel beings that have never been\nhere before that have all kinds of crazy spaces that they live in,\nand that might be AIs. It might be cyborgs. It might be hybrids. It might\nbe all sorts of things. So this idea that we have a consensus\nreality here that's independent of some very\nspecifically chosen aspects of our brain and our interaction.\nWe're gonna have to give that up no matter what to relate\nto these other beings. - I think the tension is, absolutely,\nand this idea that you're talking about, of sort of almost, I think you've\ntermed it, cognitive prosthetics. which is different ways of\nperceiving and interacting with the world. But I guess the question is, is our human experience, the direct\nhuman experience, is that just a slice of the real world, or is\nit a pointer to a different world? That's what I'm trying to... ...figure out, because the\nclaim you're making is a really fascinating one, a compelling\none. There's a pretty strong one, which is there's\nanother world into which our brain is an interface to, which\nmeans you could theoretically map that world systematically. - Yeah, which is exactly what we're\ntrying to do. I mean, we're- - Right, right, but it's not\nclear that that world exists. - Yeah, yeah, okay. I mean, so that's the\nbeautiful part about this, and this is why I'm talking about this now, whereas\nI wasn't, you know, about a year ago. Up until a year ago, I was never talking\nabout this because I think this is now actionable. So there's this diagram that's\ncalled the Map of Mathematics, and they basically try to show how all\nthe different pieces of math link together, and that there's a bunch of\ndifferent versions of it. So there's two features to this. One\nis, what is it a map of? Well, it's a map of various truths. It's\na map of facts that are thrust on you. You don't have a choice. Once you've picked\nsome axioms, you just, you know, hear some surprising facts that are\njust going to be given to you. But the other key thing about this is that\nit has a metric. It's not just a random heap of facts. They're all connected to\neach other in a particular way. They literally make a space, and so when\nI say it's a space of patterns, what I mean is it is not just a random bag\nof patterns such that when you have one pattern, you are no closer to finding any\nother pattern. I'm saying that there's some kind of a metric to it so that\nwhen you find one, others are closer to it, and then you can\nget there. So that's the claim. And obviously, this is... Now, not\neverybody buys this and so on. This is one idea. Now, how do we know that this\nexists? Well, I'll say a couple of things. If that didn't exist, what is\nthat a map of? If there is no space, if you don't want to call it a space, that's\nokay, but you can't get away from the fact that as a matter of research, there\nare patterns that relate to each other in a particular\nway. What, what's, you know, well, the final step of calling\nit a space is minimal. The bigger, bigger issue is what the hell is it a map\nof then if it's not a space? So that's that's the first thing. Now, that's how it\nplays out, I think, in math and physics. Now in biology, here's how we're going\nto know if this makes any sense. What we are doing now is trying\nto map out that space by saying, \"Look, we took... We know\nthat the frog genome maps to one thing and that's a\nfrog.\" It turns out that exact same genome, if you just, if you just\ntake the slightest step with the exact same genome, but you just take\nsome cells out of their environment, they can also make xenobots with very\nspecific different transcriptomes, very specific behaviors, very specific\nshapes. It's not just, \"Oh, well, you know, they do whatever.\" They have\nvery specific behaviors, just like the frog had very specific properties.\nWe can start to map out what all those are and basically try to draw the\nlatent space from which those things are pulled. And one of two things\nis going to happen in the future, so this is, you know, come back in 20\nyears and we'll see how this worked out. One thing that could happen is that\nwe're going to see, \"Oh, yeah, just like the map of mathematics,\nwe made a map of the space. And we know now that if I want a\nsystem that acts like this and this, here's the kind of body I need to make\nfor it, because those are the patterns that exist. The Anthrobots have four\ndifferent behaviors, not seven and not one. And so, that's what I can pull\nfrom. These are the options I have. - Is it possible that\nthere's varying degrees of grandeur to the space that\nyou're thinking about mapping? Meaning, it could be just like with\nthe space of mathematics, might it strictly be just the space of\nbiology, or is this a space of, like, minds, which feels like it could\nencompass a lot more than just biology? - Yeah. And I don't see\nhow it would be separate because I'm not just talking\nabout an anatomical shape and transcriptional profile. I'm\nalso talking about behavioral competencies. So when we make something\nand we find out that, okay, it does habituation, sensitization, it does\nnot do Pavlovian conditioning, and it does do delayed gratification,\nand it doesn't have language, that is a very specific cognitive profile. That's a\nregion of that space, and there's another region that looks different, because I\ndon't make a sharp distinction between biology and cognition. If you\nwant to explain behaviors, they are drawn from some distribution\nas well. So I think in 20 years, or however long it's going to\ntake, one of two things will happen. Either we and other people who are\nworking on this are going to actually produce a map of that space and\nsay, \"Here's why you've gotten systems that work like this and like\nthis and like this, but you've never seen any that work like that.\" Or,\nwe're going to find out that I'm wrong, and that basically\nit's not worth calling it a space, because it is so random\nand so jumbled up that there is, we've been able to make\nzero progress in linking the embodiments that we make to the\npatterns that come through. - Yeah, just to be clear,\nfrom your blog post on this from the paper, we're talking about\na space that includes a lot of stuff. - Yeah, yeah. - It includes human, what is it, meditating? Steve. \"Hello, my name is Steve.\"\nAI systems, so all those basic computational systems, objects,\nbiological systems, concepts. It includes everything. - Well, it includes specific patterns\nthat we have given names to. - Right. - Some of those patterns we've named\nmathematical objects. Some of those patterns we've named anatomical outcomes.\nSome of those patterns we've named psychological types. - So every entry in an encyclopedia,\nold-school Britannica, is a pointer to this space. - There is a set of things that I feel\nvery strongly about because the research is telling us that's what's going on,\nand then there's a bunch of other stuff that I see as hypotheses for next\nsteps that guide experiment. So what I'm about to tell you, these\nare things I don't actually know. These are just guesses\nthat you need to make some guesses to make progress. I\ndon't think that there are specific, or I don't know, but it\ndoesn't mean that there are going to be specific platonic patterns for, \"This\nis the Titanic, and this is the sister of the Titanic, and this is some other\nkind of boat.\" This is not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is, in some\nway that we absolutely need to work out when we make minimal interfaces, we get more than we put in. We get\nbehaviors. We get shapes. We get mathematical truths, and we\nget all kinds of patterns that we did not have to create. We didn't micromanage\nthem. We didn't know they were coming. We didn't have to put any effort into\nmaking them. They come from some distribution that seems to exist\nthat we don't have to create. And exactly whether that space\nis sparse or dense, I don't know. So for example, if there\nis a, you know, some kind of a platonic form for the movie, The Godfather, if it's surrounded by a bunch of crappy\nversions and then crappier versions still, I have no idea, right? I don't know if\nthe space is sparse or not. I, you know, I don't know if it's finite or\ninfinite. These are all things I don't know. What I do know is that it seems like physics, and for sure\nbiology and cognition, are the benefits of ingressions that are\nfree lunches in some sense. We did not make them. Calling them\nemergent does nothing for a research program, okay? That just means you\ngot surprised. I think it's much better if you say, if you make the\noptimistic assumption that they come from a structured space, that we have a\nprayer in hell of actually exploring. And in some decades, if I'm wrong, and it\nsays, \"You know what? We tried. It looks like it really is random. Too bad.\" Fine. - Is there a difference between, like\ncan we one day prove the existence of this world? And is there a difference\nbetween it being a really effective model for connecting things, explaining\nthings, versus like an actual place where the information about these\ndistributions that we're sampling actually exists, that we\ncan hit with a stick? - You... Yeah, you can try\nto make that distinction. But I think, I think modern\ncognitive neuroscience will tell you that whatever you think this is, at most, it is a very effective\nmodel for predicting the future experiences you're going to have. - So all of this that we think about as\nphysical reality is a nice, convenient model. - I mean, that's not me. That's predictive\nprocessing and active inference. That's modern neuroscience telling you this,\nthat this isn't anything that I'm particularly coming up with. All\nI'm saying is the distinction, the distinction you're trying to make, which is\nlike an old school, realist, you know, kind of view, that is it metaphorical or is it real? All we have in\nscience are metaphors, I think, and the only question is how good are\nyour metaphors. And I think as agents act, living in a world,\nall we have are models of what we are and what the outside world\nis. That's it. And the question is, how good is it a model? And my\nclaim about this is in some small number of decades, this\nwill either give rise to a very enabling mapping\nof the space for, for AI, for bio-engineering, for,\nyou know, biology, whatever. Or we are going to find out that it really sucks, because it really\nis a random grab bag of stuff, and we tried the optimistic research program, it failed,\nand we're just going to have to live with surprise. I mean, I doubt that's going to\nhappen, but it's a possible outcome. - But do you think it's, there is some place\nwhere the information is stored about these distributions that are being\nsampled through the thin interfaces? Like actual place? - Place is weird because it isn't the\nsame as our physical space-time, okay? I don't think it's that. So calling it\na place is a little, a little weird. - No, but like physics, general\nrelativity describes a space-time. - Okay. - Could other physics theories\nbe able to describe this other space where information is\nstored that we can apply, maybe different, but in the same\nspirit, laws about... - Yes - ... information? - I definitely think there are going to be\nsystematic laws. I don't think they're going to look anything like physics. You can call it physics\nif you want, but I think it's going to be so different that that probably just,\nyou know, cracks the word. Um, and whether information is\ngoing to survive that, I'm not sure. But I definitely think that it's\ngoing to be, there are going to be laws. But I think they're\ngoing to look a lot more like aspects of psychology and cognitive\nscience than they're going to look like physics. That's my guess. - So what does it look like\nto prove that world exists? - What it looks like is a\nsuccessful research program that explains how you pull\nparticular patterns when you need them, and why some patterns\ncome and others don't, and show that they come from an ordered space. - Across a large number of organisms? - Well, it's not just organisms. I mean,\nI think it's going to end up, and I mean, you can talk to the machine learning\npeople about how they got to this point. Again, because this is not just me.\nThere's a bunch of different disciplines that are converging on this now\nsimultaneously. You're going to find again, just like in mathematics,\nwhere from different directions everybody sort of is looking at different things.\nSay, \"Oh my God, this is one underlying structure that seems to like inform all of\nthis.\" So in physics, in mathematics, in computer\nscience, machine learning, possibly in economics, certainly\nin biology, possibly in, you know, cognitive science, we're going to find\nthese structures. It was already obvious in Pythagoras' time that there\nare these patterns. The only remaining question is, are they part of an\nordered structured space, and are we up to the task of mapping out the\nrelationship between what we build and the patterns\nthat come through it? - So from the machine\nlearning perspective, is it then the case that even\nsomething as simple as LLMs are sneaking up onto this world,\nthat the representations that they form are sneaking up to it? - When, when... I've given\nthis talk to some audiences, especially in the organicist\ncommunity. People like the first part where\nit's like, \"Okay, now there's an idea for what the\nmagic, quote unquote, is. That's special about living\nthings,\" and so on. Now, if we could just stop there, we would\nhave dumb machines that just do what the algorithm says, and we have\nthese magical living interfaces that can be the recipient for these ingressions.\nCool, right? We can cut up the world in this way. Unfortunately or fortunately I think, that's not the case.\nAnd I think that even, even simple minimal computational models are to some extent beneficiaries of\nthese free lunches. I think that the theories we have, and this goes\nback to the, to the thin client interface kind of idea.\nThe theories we have of both physics and computation, so theory\nof algorithms, you know, Turing machines, all that good stuff. Those are all good\ntheories of the front end interface, and they're not complete theories of the whole\nthing. They capture the front end which is why they get surprised, which is why\nthese things are surprising when they happen. I think that when we see\nembryos of different species, we are pulling from well-trodden\nfamiliar regions of that space, and we know what to\nexpect. Frog, you know, snake, whatever. When we make cyborgs and hybrids\nand biobots, we are pulling from new regions of that space that look a little\nweird and they're unexpected, but you know, we can still kind of get our, get\nour mind around them. When we start making AIs, proper AIs, we are now fishing in a region of that space\nthat may never have had bodies before. It may have never been\nembodied before. And what we get from that is going to be extremely\nsurprising. And the final thing just to mention on that is that because of this, because of the inputs from\nthis platonic space, some of the really interesting things that\nartificial constructs can do are not because of the algorithm, they're\nin spite of the algorithm. They are filling up the spaces in between. There's\nwhat the algorithm is forcing you to do, and then there's the other cool stuff it's\ndoing which is nowhere in the algorithm. And if that's true, and we think\nit's true even of very minimal systems, then this whole business of- of\nof language models and AIs in general, watching the language part may be a total\nred herring because the language is what we force them to do. The question\nis, what- what are, what else are they doing that we are not, we are\nnot good at noticing? And this is, you know, this- this- this is something that\nwe are I think as a, as a kind of an existential step for\nhumanity is to, is to become better at this because we are not\ngood at recognizing these things now. - You got to tell me more\nabout this behavior that is observable, that is\nunrelated to the explicitly stated goal of a particular algorithm.\nSo you looked at a simple algorithm of, Sorting. Can you explain what was done? - Sure. First, just the goal of this study, there\nare two things that people generally assume. One is that we have a\npretty good intuition about what kind of systems are\ngonna have competencies. So from observing biologicals, we're not terribly\nsurprised when biology does interesting things. Everybody always says, \"Well, it's\nbiology, you know, of course it does all this cool stuff.\" But do we have these machines? And the whole point of having\nmachines and algorithms and so on, is they do exactly what you tell them to\ndo, right? And people feel pretty strongly that that's a binary distinction,\nand that's how we can carve up the world in that way. So,\nI wanted to do two things. I wanted to first of all, explore that and\nhopefully break the assumption that we're good at seeing this, because I\nthink we're not. And I think it's extremely important that we understand very\nsoon that we need to get much better at knowing when to expect these\nthings. And the other thing I wanted to do was to find\nout, you know, mostly people assume that you need a\nlot of complexity for this. So when somebody says, \"Well, the\ncapabilities of my mind are not properly encompassed by the rules of biochemistry,\"\neverybody's like, \"Yeah, that makes sense.\" Where, you know, you're very complex\nand okay, your mind does things that you didn't see coming from the\nrules of biochemistry, right? We know that. So mostly people\nthink that has to do with complexity. And what I would like to find out\nis, as part of understanding what kind of interfaces give rise to what kind of\nengressions, is it really about complexity? How much complexity do you actually\nneed? Is there some threshold after which this happens? Is it\nreally specific materials? Is it biologicals? Is it something about\nevolution? Like, what is it about these kinds of things that allows this\nsurprise, right? Allows this idea that we are more than the\nsum of our parts. And I had a strong intuition that none of those\nthings are actually required, that this kind of magic, so to speak,\nseeps into pretty much everything. And so to\nlook at that, I wanted also to have an example that\nhad significant shock value. Because the thing with biology is there's always more mechanism to be discovered,\nright? There's infinite depth of what the materials are doing. Somebody will always say, \"Well,\nthere's a mechanism for that, you just haven't found it yet.\" So I wanted an example that\nwas simple, transparent, so you could see all the stuff. There was nowhere\nto hide. I wanted it to be deterministic, because I don't want it to be something\naround unpredictability or stochasticity, and I wanted it to be something\nfamiliar to people, minimal. And I wanted to use it as a model system for\nhoning our abilities to take a new system and looking at it\nwith fresh eyes. And that's because these sorting algorithms\nhave been studied for over 60 years. We all think we know what they do and what their\nproperties are. The algorithm itself is just a few lines of code, you know? You can\nsee exactly what's there. It's deterministic. So that's\nwhy, right? I wanted the most shock value out of a system like\nthat, if we were to find anything, and to use it as an example of taking\nsomething minimal and seeing what can be gotten out of it. So I'll describe two\ninteresting things about it, and then we have lots of other work coming\nin the next year about even simpler systems. I mean,\nit's actually crazy. Um, so the very first thing is this.\nThe standard sorting. So let's say bubble sort, right? And all these sorting\nalgorithms, you know, what you're starting out with is an array of\njumbled-up digits, okay? So, integers. It's an array of\nmixed-up integers, and what the algorithm is designed\nto do is to eventually arrange them all into order, and what it\ndoes, generally, is compare some pieces of that array and, based on which one is\nlarger than which, it swaps them around. And you can imagine that if you just keep doing\nthat and you keep comparing and swapping, then eventually you can get all the digits in the\nsame order. So, the first thing I decided to do, and this is the work\nof my student Kaining Zhang and then Adam Goldstein on this\npaper, this goes back to our original discussion about putting a barrier\nbetween it and its goals. And the first thing I said, \"Okay, how do we put a barrier\nin?\" Well, how about this? The traditional algorithm assumes that the hardware is working\ncorrectly. So if you have a seven and then a five, and you tell them\nto swap, the lines that swap the five and the seven,\nand then you go on, you never check, \"Did it swap?\" Because\nyou assume that it's reliable hardware, okay? So what\nwe decided to do was to break one of the digits so that it doesn't move.\nWhen you tell it to move, it doesn't move. We don't change the algorithm. That's really\nkey. We do not put anything new in the algorithm that says, \"What do you do if the damn\nthing didn't move?\" Okay? Just run it exactly the same way. What happens?\nTurns out, something very interesting happens. It still works.\nIt still sorts it, but it eventually sorts it by\nmoving all the stuff around the broken number, okay? And that makes sense,\nbut here's something interesting. Suppose we plot, at any given\nmoment, the degree of sortedness of the string as a\nfunction of time. If you run the normal algorithm, it's guaranteed\nto get where it's going. That's it, you know, it's got to sort,\nand it will always reach the end. But when it encounters one of\nthe broken digits, what happens is, the actual sortedness goes down. In\norder to then recoup and get better order later. What it's able to do is to go\nagainst the thing that it's trying to do, to go around in order\nto meet its goal later on. Now, if I showed this to\na behavior scientist, and I didn't tell him what system was doing,\nthey would say, \"Well, we know what this is. This is delayed gratification.\"\nThis is the ability of a system to go against its gradient and get what\nit needs to do. Now, imagine two magnets. Imagine you take two magnets and you put\na piece of wood between them, and they're like this. What the magnet is not\ngoing to do is to go around the barrier and get to its goal. The two...\nThey're not smart enough to go against their gradient. They're just going to keep doing\nthis. Some animals are smart enough, right? They'll go around, and... The sorting\nalgorithm is smart enough to do that. But the trick is\nthere are no steps in the algorithm for doing that. You could stare\nat the algorithm all day long. You would not see that this thing can do delayed\ngratification. It isn't there. Now, there's two ways to look at this. On the one hand, you could say this,\nor the reductionist physics approach, you could say, \"Did it follow all the steps in the\nalgorithm?\" You say, \"Yeah, it did.\" Well, then there's nothing to see here.\nThere's no magic. This is, you know, it does what it does. It\ndidn't disobey the algorithm, right? I'm not claiming that this is a\nmiracle. I'm not saying it disobeys the algorithm. I'm saying it's not failing to\nsort. I'm saying it's not doing some sort of, you know, crazy quantum thing. Not\nsaying any of that. What I'm saying is other people might call it emergent.\nWhat it has are properties that are not complexity, not unpredictability,\nnot perverse instantiation as in sometimes in ALife. What it has are unexpected competencies\nrecognizable by behavioral scientists, meaning different\ntypes of cognition. Primitive. We wanted primitive,\nso there you go. It's simple that you didn't have to code into the\nalgorithm. That's very important. You get more than you start with, than you put\nin. You didn't have to do that. You get these surprising behavioral\ncompetencies, not just complexity. That's the first thing. The second thing,\nwhich is also crazy, but it requires a little bit of explanation.\nThe second thing that we said is, \"Okay, what if instead of in\nthe typical sorting algorithm, you have a single controller top-down?\" I'm sort\nof godlike looking down at the numbers and I'm swapping them according to the\nalgorithm. What if, and this goes back to actually the title of the paper talks\nabout agential data, self-sorting algorithms. This is back to like, who's\nthe pattern and who's the agent, right? You say, \"What if we give the numbers a little\nbit of agency?\" Here's what we're going to we're not going to have any kind of\ntop-down sort. Every single number knows the algorithm, and he's just going to\ndo whatever the algorithm says. So if I'm a five, I'm just going to\nexecute the algorithm, and the algorithm will try to make sure that to my\nright is the six and to my left is a four. That's it. So every digit is, so it's like\na distributed, you know, it's like an ant colony. There is no central planner.\nEverybody just does their own algorithm, okay? We're just going to do that. Once you've done\nthat, and by the way, one of the values of doing that is that you can simulate\nbiological processes because in biology, you know, if I have like a frog\nface and I scramble it with all the different organs, every, every tissue\nis going to rearrange itself so that ultimately you have, you know, nose, eyes,\nhead. You're going to have an order, right? So you can do that. But, okay, fine,\nbut you can do something else cool. Once you've done that, you can do something cool\nthat you can't do with a standard algorithm. You can make a chimeric algorithm. What\nI mean is not all the cells have to follow the same algorithm. Some of them might\nfollow bubble sort, some of them might follow selection sort. It's like in biology what\nwe do when we make chimeras, we make frogolottles. So frogolottles have some\nfrog cells, they have some axolotl cells. What is that going to look like? Does\nanybody know what a frogolottle is going to look like? It's actually really interesting that despite\nall the genetics and the and the developmental biology, you have the genomes, you have\nthe frog genome, you have the axolotl genome. Nobody can tell you what a frogolottle is\ngoing to look like, even though you have, yeah. This is, this is back to your question about\nphysics and chemistry. Like, yeah, you can know everything there is to know about\nhow, you know, how the physics and the and the genetics work, but the decision-making,\nright? Is like baby frog, baby axolotls have legs. Tadpoles don't\nhave legs. Is a frogolottle going to have legs, right? Can you predict that\nfrom understanding the physics of transcription and all of that?\nAnyway, so, so we made some, uh... S- so, so you, you see this as like\nan intersection of biology, physics- ...cognition. So we made\nchimeric algorithms, and we said, \"Okay, half the digits randomly.\" We assigned\nthem randomly. So half the digits are randomly doing bubble sort, half the digits are randomly doing,\nI don't know, selection sort or something. - But that... once you choose bubble sort,\nthat digit is sticking with bubble sort. - It's sticking. We haven't done the thing\nwhere they can swap between... no. But they're, they're sticking to it, right?\nYou label them and they're sticking to it. The first thing we learned is that... Well, the\nfirst thing we learned is that distributed sorting still works. It's amazing. You don't\nneed a central planner when every number is doing its own thing, still gets sorted.\nThat's cool. The second thing we found is that when you make a chimeric\nalgorithm where actually the algorithms are not even matching,\nthat works too. The thing still gets sorted. That's cool. But the most\namazing thing is when we looked at something that had nothing to do with sorting,\nand that is we asked the following question. We defined... Adam Goldstein actually named\nthis property, and I think it's well-named. We define the algotype of a single cell. It's not\nthe genotype, it's not the phenotype, it's the algotype. The algotype is simply this: What\nalgorithm are you following? Which one are you? Are you a selection sort or a bubble sort,\nright? That's it. There are two algotypes. And we simply ask the following\nquestion: \"During that process of sorting, what are the odds that whatever algotype you are, the guys next\nto you are your same type?\" It's not the same as asking how the numbers are sorted because\nit's got nothing to do with the numbers. It's actually... it's just whatever type you are. - It's more about clustering than sorting. - Clustering. Well, that's exactly what we call it.\nWe call it clustering. And at first, so, so now think of what happens, and that's... and you\ncan see this on that graph, it's the red. You start off, the clustering is at\n50% because as I told you, we assign the algotypes randomly. So the odds that the\nguy next to you is the same as you is half, 50%, right? Because there are only\ntwo algotypes. In the end, it is also 50% because the thing\nthat dominates is actually the sorting algorithm, and the sorting algorithm doesn't care\nwhat type you are. You've got to get the numbers in order. So by the time you're done, you're\nback to random algotypes because you have to get the numbers sorted. But\nin between, in between you get some amount of increased... very significant, because\nlook at... look at the control, it's in the middle, the pink is in the\nmiddle. In between you get significant amounts of clustering, meaning\nthat certain algotypes like to hang out with their buddies for as long as\nthey can. Now, now, here's, here's the... one more thing and then I'll kind of give\nthe philosophical significance of this. And so we saw this and I said, \"That's nuts\nbecause the algorithm doesn't have any provisions for asking what\nalgotype am I, what algotype is my neighbor. If we're not the same, I'm going\nto move to be next to...\" Like if you wanted to implement this, you would have to write a whole bunch\nof extra steps. There would have to be a whole bunch of observations that you would have to take\nof your neighbor to see how he's acting. Then you would infer what algotype he\nis. Then you would go stand next to the one that seems to have the same algotype as you. You\nwould have to take a bunch of measurements to say, \"Wait, is that guy doing bubble sort or is he doing selection sort,\"\nright? Like if you wanted to implement this, it's a whole bunch of algorithmic steps. None of that exists\nin our algorithm. You don't have any way of knowing what algotype you are or what anyone\nelse is. Okay. We didn't have to pay for that at all. So notice a couple of interesting\nthings. The first interesting thing is that this was not at all obvious from the algorithm itself. The algorithm\ndoesn't say anything about algotypes. Second thing is we paid computationally\nfor all the steps needed to have the numbers sorted, right? Because we know, you\nknow, you pay for a certain computation cost. The clustering was free. We didn't pay\nfor that at all. There were no extra steps. So this gets back to your other question of how\ndo we know there's a platonic space, and this is kind of like one of the craziest things that we're\ndoing. I actually suspect we can get free compute out of it. I suspect that one of\nthe things that we can do here is use these ingressions in a useful\nway that don't require you to pay costs to pay physical costs. Right? Because\nwe know every bit has an energy cost that you have to get. The clustering\nwas free. Nothing extra was done. - This plot, for people who are just\nlistening, on the X-axis is the percentage of completion of the\nsorting process and the Y-axis is the sortedness of the listed numbers,\nand then also in the red line is basically the degree to which\nthey're clustered. And, you're saying that there's\nthis unexpected competence of clustering. And I should\ncomment that I'm sure there's a theoretical computer scientist\nlistening to this saying, \"I can model exactly what is happening here and\nprove that the clustering increases and decreases.\" So taking the\nspecific instantiation of the thing you've experimented with and\nprove certain properties of this. But the point is that\nthere's a more general pattern here of probably other\nthings that you haven't discovered, unexpected competencies that emerge from this, that\nyou can get free computation out of this thing. get free computation out of this thing. - So this goes back to the very first thing\nyou said about physicists thinking that physics is enough. You're 100%\ncorrect that somebody could look at this and say, \"Well, I see exactly\nwhy this is happening. We can track through the algorithm.\" Yeah,\nyou can. There's no miracle going on here, right? The hardware isn't doing some\ncrazy thing that it wasn't supposed to do. The point is that despite\nfollowing the algorithm to do one thing, it is also at the same time\ndoing other things that are neither prescribed nor forbidden by the\nalgorithm. It's the space between chance and necessity, which is how\na lot of people see these things. It's that free space. We don't really\nhave a good vocabulary for it, where the interesting things happen. And to\nwhatever extent it's doing other things that are useful, that stuff is\ncomputationally without extra cost. Now, there's one other cool\nthing about this. And this is the beginning of a lot of thinking that\nI've done about this. This relates to AI and stuff like that:\nintrinsic motivations. The sorting of the digits\nis what we forced it to do. The clustering is an\nintrinsic motivation. We didn't ask for it. We didn't expect\nit to happen. We didn't, we didn't explicitly forbid it,\nbut we didn't, you know, we didn't know. This is a great definition of the\nintrinsic motivation of a system. So when people say, \"Oh, that's a machine, it\nonly does what you programmed it to do.\" as a human have intrinsic\nmotivation. You know I'm creative and I have intrinsic motivation. Machines\ndon't do that. Even this minimal thing has a minimal kind of intrinsic\nmotivation, which is something that is not forbidden by the\nalgorithm, but isn't prescribed by the algorithm either. And I think that's\nan important, you know, third thing besides chance and necessity. Something\nelse that's fun about this is when you think about intrinsic\nmotivations, think about a child. child. If you make him sit\nin math class all day, you're never going to know what the other intrinsic\nmotivations are that he might be doing, right? Like, who knows what else he might\nbe interested in. So I wanted to ask this question. I want to say, if\nwe let off the pressure on the sorting, what would happen? Now,\nthat's hard because if you mess with the algorithm, now it's no longer the\nsame algorithm, so you don't want to do that. So we did something that I think was\nkind of clever. We allowed repeat digits. So if you allow repeat digits\nin your array, you can still have all the fives, can still be after all\nthe fours and after all the sixes, but you can keep them as\nclustered as you want. So this thing at the end where they have to\nget declustered in order for the sorting to happen, we thought maybe we could let off the\npressure a little bit. If you do that, all you do is allow some extra repeat\ndigits, the clustering gets bigger. It will cluster as much as\nyou let it. The clustering is what it wants to do. The sorting is\nwhat we're forcing it to do. And my only point\nis, if the bubble sort, which has been gone over and\ngone over how many times, has these kinds of things that we didn't\nsee coming, what about the AIs, the language model, everything else? Not\nbecause they talk, not because they say that they're, you know, have an inner\nperspective or any of that, but just from the fact that this thing is even\nthe most minimal system surprises with what happens. And\nfrankly, when I see this, tell me if this doesn't sound like\nall of our existential story. For the brief time that we're here,\nthe universe is going to grind us into dust eventually, but until then,\nwe get to do some cool stuff that is intrinsically motivating\nto us, that is neither forbidden by the laws of physics\nnor determined by the laws of physics, but eventually, it\nkind of comes to an end. So I think that aspect of it, right, that, um, there are spaces. Even\nin algorithms, there are spaces in which you can do other new\nthings, not just random stuff, not just complex stuff, but things that are easily\nrecognizable to a behavior scientist. You see, that's the point\nhere. And I think that kind of intrinsic motivation is what's\ntelling us that this idea that we can carve up the world, we can\nsay, \"Okay, look, biology is complex. Cognition, who knows what's responsible\nfor that, but at least we can take a chunk of the world aside and\nwe can cut it off and we can say, these are the dumb machines.\"\nThese are just these algorithms... Whereas we know the rules of\nbiochemistry don't explain everything we want to know about how psychology\nis going to go, but at least the rules of algorithms tell us exactly what the machines\nare going to do, right? We have some hope that we've carved off a little part of the world\nand everything is nice and simple and it is exactly what we said it was going to be. I\nthink that failed. I think it was a good try. I think we have good\ntheories of interfaces, but even even the simplest algorithms\nhave these kinds of things going on. And so that's why I think\nsomething like this is significant. - Do you think that there is\ngoing to be in all kinds of systems of varying complexity\nthings that the system wants to do and things that it's\nforced to do? So, are there these unexpected competencies to be discovered in basically all\nalgorithms and all systems? - That's my suspicion, and I think that\nit is extremely important for us as humans to have a research program\nto learn to recognize and predict. We make things... Never mind something\nas simple as this. We make, you know, social structures, financial\nstructures, Internet of Things, robotics, AI, so we make all this\nstuff, and we think that the thing we make it do is the main show.\nAnd I think it is very important for us to learn to recognize\nthe kind of stuff that sneaks into the spaces. - What if, what... It's a very counterintuitive\nnotion. By the way, I like the word emergent. I hear your\ncriticism and it's a really strong one, that emergent is\nlike you toss your hands up, but I don't know the process, but it's\njust a beautiful word, because it is... I guess it's a\nsynonym for surprising. And I mean, this is very surprising,\nbut just because it's surprising doesn't mean there's not a\nmechanism that explains it. - Mechanism and explanation are both not all they're cracked up to be in the\nsense that, you know, anything you and I do, we could come up with\nthe most beautiful theory. We paint a painting, anything we do.\nSomebody could say, \"Well, I was watching the biochemistry\nand the Schrodinger equation playing out,\nand it totally described everything that was happening. You didn't\nbreak even a single law of biochemistry. Nothing to see here, nothing\nto see, right?\" Like, okay, you know, consistent with the\nlow-level rules, you can do the same thing here. You can look at the machine code and say,\n\"Yeah, this thing is just executing machine code.\" You can go further and say, \"Oh, it's quantum\nfoam. It's just doing the thing that quantum foam does.\" - You're saying that's what physicists miss. - Well, and I'm not saying they're unaware of\nthat. I mean, they're generally a pretty sophisticated bunch. I just think\nthey've picked a level and they're going to discover what is to be\nseen at that level, which is a lot. And my point is, the stuff that\nthe behavior scientists are interested in shows up at a much\nlower level than you think. - How often do you think there's a misalignment\nof this kind between the thing that a system is forced to do and what it wants to do? And it's\nparticularly... I'm thinking about various levels of\ncomplexity of AI systems. - So right now, we've looked at, like,\nfive other systems. That's a small N, okay? But just looking\nat that, I would find it very surprising if bubble sort was able to do this, and then there was some\nsort of valley of death where nothing showed up, and then living things.\nLike, I can't imagine that. say that if something... And we actually have a\nsystem that's even simpler than this, which is 1D cellular automata that's doing some\nweird stuff. If these things are to be found in this kind of simple\nsystem, I mean, they just have to be showing up in these\nother more complex AIs and things like that. The only thing we don't\nknow, but we're going to find out, is to what extent\nthere is interaction between these. So I call these things\nside quests, you know. It's like, like in a game, you know, with the main\nthing you're supposed to do. And as long as you still do it, the\nthing about this is you have to sort. You have to sort. There's no miracle.\nYou're going to sort. But as long as you can do other stuff while you're\nsorting, it's not forbidden. And what we don't know is, to what extent\nare the two things linked? So if you do have a system that's very good at language, are the\nothers, the side quests that it's capable of, do they have anything to do with language whatsoever? We don't know the answer\nto that. The answer might be no, in which case all of the stuff that\nwe've been saying about language models because of what they're saying, all of\nthat could be a total red herring and not really important, and the really exciting\nstuff is what we never looked for. Or in complex systems, maybe those things\nbecome linked. In biology, they're linked. In biology, evolution makes sure\nthat the things you're capable of have a lot to do with what you've actually\nbeen selected for. In these things, I don't know, and so we might find out that\nthey actually do give the language some sort of leg up, or we might\nfind that the language is just you know, that's not the interesting part. - Also, it is an interesting\nquestion of this intrinsic motivation of clustering. Is this a property of the particular\nsorting algorithms? Is this a property of all\nsorting algorithms? Is this a property of all algorithms\noperating on lists, on numbers? How big is this? So\nfor example, with LLMs, is it a property of any algorithm\nthat's trying to model language, or is it very specific to\ntransformers and that's all to be discovered? - We're doing all that. We're testing this stuff\nin other algorithms. We're looking for... We're developing suites of code\nto look for other properties. We, you know, to some extent, it's very\nhard because we don't know what to look for, but we do have a behaviorist\nhandbook which tells you all kinds of things to look for: the delayed\ngratification, the problem solving, like, we have all that. I'll\ntell you an N of one of an interesting biological intrinsic\nmotivation, because people... So in the alignment community and stuff,\nthere's a lot of discussion about what are the intrinsic motivations going to be of AIs?\nWhat are their goals going to be, right? What are they going to want to do? Just\nas an N of one observation, anthrobots, the very first thing\nwe checked for... So this is not experiment number 972 out of a thousand\nthings. This is the very first thing we checked for. We put them on a plate of\nneurons with a big wound through them, a big scratch. First thing they did was\nheal the wound, okay? So it's an N of one, but I like the fact that the\nfirst intrinsic motivation that we noticed out of that system was benevolent\nand healing. I thought that was pretty cool. And we don't know. Maybe the next 20 things we\nfind are going to be some sort of, you know, damaging effects. I can't tell you\nthat. But the first thing that we saw was kind of a positive one. And I\ndon't know, that makes me feel better. - What was the thing you mentioned with the\nanthrobots that they can reverse aging? - There's a procedure called\nan epigenetic clock where what you can do is look at\nparticular epigenetic states of cells and compare to a\ncurve that was built from humans of known age. You\ncan guess what the age is. Okay? So we can take now, and this is\nSteve Horvath's work, and many other people, that when you take a set of cells,\nyou can guess what their biological age is. Okay? So we make the anthrobots from cells that we get from human\ntracheal epithelium. We collaborated with Steve's group, the\nClock Foundation. We sent them a bunch of cells and we saw that if\nyou check the anthrobots themselves, they are roughly 20% younger than\nthe cells they come from. That's that's amazing, and I can\ngive you a theory of why that happens, although we're still\ninvestigating. And then I could tell you the implications for longevity and things\nlike that. My theory for why it happens, I call this age evidencing.\nAnd I think that what's happening here, like with a lot of biology, is\nthat cells have to update their priors based on experience. And\nso I think that they come from an old body. They have a lot of priors about\nhow many years they've been around and all that, but their new environment\nscreams, \"I'm an embryo,\" basically. There are no other cells around. You're being bent\ninto a pretzel. They actually express some embryonic genes. They say, \"You're\nan embryo.\" And I think it doesn't... It's not enough new\nevidence to roll them all the way back, but it's enough to\nupdate them to about 28% back. - Yeah, so it's similar to, like when\nolder adult gives birth to a child. You're saying you could just\nfake it till you make it with with age? Like, the environment\nconvinces the cell that it's young? - Well, first of all, yeah, yes.\nAnd that's that's my hypothesis. - That's nice - And we have a whole bunch of research being\ndone on this. There was a study where they went into an old age home\nand they redid the décor, like '60s style, when all these\nfolks were really young. And they they found all kinds of improvements in\nblood chemistry and stuff like that, because they say it was sort of mentally taking\nthem back to when, you know, when they were the way they were at that time. I\nthink this is a basal version of that, that basically if you're finding\nyourself in an embryonic environment, what's more\nplausible, that you're young or or what? You know, like,\nI think this is the basic feature of biology, is to update\npriors based on experience. - Do you think that's\nactually actionable for longevity? Like, you can convince cells\nthat they're younger and thereby extend their lifespan? - This is what we're trying to do, yeah. - Could it be as simple as that? - Well, that's not simple.\nThat is in no way simple. But because again you have\nto... All of this, all of the regenerative medicine stuff that\nwe do balances on one key thing, which is learning to communicate to the\nsystem. We have to... If you're going to convince that system... You know,\nso when we make gut tissue into an eye, you have to convince those cells\nthat their priors about, \"We are gut precursors,\" those priors are wrong\nand you should adopt this new worldview that you're going to be, you know,\nyou're going to be an eye. So being convincing and figuring out what kind\nof messages are convincing to cells and how to speak the language\nand how to make them take on new, new beliefs, literally, is at the root of all of these future advances in birth\ndefects and regenerative medicine and cancer. And that's what's going on here.\nSo I'm not saying it's simple, but I can see the path. - Going back to the Platonic\nspace, I have to ask if if our brains are indeed\nthin client interfaces to that space, what does that mean for\nour mind? Like, can we upload the mind? Can we copy it? Can we ship it over\nto other planets? What does that mean for exactly where the mind is stored? - Yeah. Couple of things. So we\nare now beyond anything that I can say with any certainty. This is total\nconjecture. Okay? Because we don't know yet. The whole point of this is we actually don't really\nunderstand very well the relationship between the interface and the thing. - And the thing you're currently\nworking on is to map- - Correct. - this space? - Correct. And we are beginning to map\nit, but, you know, this is a massive effort. So a couple of\nconjectures here. One is that I strongly suspect that the majority\nof what we think of as the mind is the pattern in that\nspace. Okay? And one of the interesting predictions from that\nmodel, which is not a prediction of modern neuroscience, is that\nthere should be cases where there is very minimal brain, and yet\nnormal IQ function. This has been seen clinically. Corrina Kaufman and I reviewed\nthis in a paper recently, a bunch of cases of humans where there's very little\nbrain tissue, and they have normal or, and sometimes above normal\nintelligence. Now, things are not simple because that obviously doesn't happen\nall the time, right? Most of the time it doesn't happen. So, what's going on?\nWe don't understand. But it is a very curious thing that is not a prediction\nof... I'm not saying, I'm not saying it can't... You know, you can take modern\nneuroscience and sort of bend it into a pretzel to accommodate it. You can say,\n\"Well, there are these, you know, kind of redundancies and things like this,\" right? So\nyou can accommodate it, but it doesn't predict this. So there are these incredibly curious\ncases. Now, do I think you can copy it? No. I don't think you\ncan, because what you're going to be copying is the interface,\nthe front end. The brain or the, you know, whatever. The action\nis actually the pattern in the Platonic space. Are you going to be able to\ncopy that? I doubt it. But what you could do is produce another interface\nthrough which that particular pattern is going to come through. I think\nthat's probably possible. I can't say anything about... At this point,\nabout what that would take, but my guess is that that's possible. - Is your guess, your gut, that that\nprocess, if possible, is different than copying? Like, it looks more like\ncreating a new thing versus copying. - for the interface. So if\nyou could... So, here's my prediction for Star Trek transporter.\nFor whatever reason, right now, your brain and body are very attuned and attractive to a particular\npattern, which is your set of psychological propensities. If we could rebuild\nthat exact same thing somewhere else, I rebuild that exact same\nthing somewhere else, I don't see any reason why that same pattern\nwouldn't come through it the same way it comes through this one. That's... That would\nbe a guess, you know? So, I think what you will be copying is the\nphysical interface, and hoping to maintain whatever it is about\nthat interface that was appropriate for that pattern. We don't really\nknow what that is at this point. - So, when we've been talking about mind,\nin this particular case it's the most important to me because I'm a human.\nDoes self come along with that? Does the feeling, like,\nthis mind belongs to me? Does that come along with\nall minds? The subjective Not the subjective experience. The\nsubjective experience is important too, consciousness. But like, the ownership. - I suspect so, and I think so because of\nthe way we come into being. So, one of the things that I should be working on is this paper called Booting Up the Agent, and\nit talks about the very earliest steps of becoming a being in this world. Kind of\nlike you can do this for a computer, right? Before you switch the power\non, it belongs to the domain of physics, right? It obeys the laws of\nphysics. You switch the power on, some number of, what, nanoseconds,\nmicroseconds, I don't know, later, you have a thing that, oh look, it's\ntaking instructions off the stack and doing them, right? So now it's\nexecuting an algorithm. How did you get from physics to executing an\nalgorithm? Like, what was happening during the boot up exactly before\nit starts to run code or whatever, right? And so we can ask\nthat same question in biology. What are the earliest\nsteps of becoming a being? - Yeah, that's a fascinating question. Through\nembryogenesis, at which point is the Are you booting on? Do you have\na hope of an answer to that? - Well, I think so. I think\nso in two ways. The first thing is just physically what happens.\nSo, I think that your first task as a being, and again, I\ndon't think this is a binary thing. I think this is a positive\nfeedback loop that sort of cranks on up and up. Your first task as a\nbeing coming into this world is to tell a very compelling story to your\nparts. As a biological, you are made of agential parts. Those parts\nneed to be aligned, literally, into a into a goal they have no comprehension\nof. If you're going to move through anatomical space by means\nof a bunch of cells which only know physiological and, you know, metabolic\nspaces and things like that, you are going to have to\ndevelop a model and give them, bend their action space. You're going\nto have to deform their option space with signals, with behavior\nshaping cues, with rewards and punishments, whatever you\ngot. Your job as an agent is ownership of your parts, is\nalignment of your parts. I think that fundamentally is going to\ngive rise to this ability. Now, that also means having a boundary\nsaying, \"Okay, this is the stuff I control. This is me. This other stuff over here is\noutside world.\" I have to figure out... You don't know where that is, by\nthe way. You have to figure it out. And in embryogenesis, it's really cool.\nAs a grad student, I used to do this experiment with duck embryos, which are\na flat blastodisc. You can take a needle and put some scratches into it, and every island\nyou make, for a while until they heal up, thinks it's the only embryo. There's nothing\nelse around, so it becomes an embryo. And eventually you get twins and triplets\nand quadruplets and things like that. But each one of them at the\nborder, you know, they're joined. Well, where do I end and where does\nhe begin? You have to know what your borders are. So that action of aligning your parts and coming\nto be this, this, this, uh... I mean, I'm even going to say it,\nthis emergence. We just don't have a good vocabulary for it. This emergence\nof a model that aligns all the parts is really critical to keep that thing\ngoing. There's something else that's really interesting, and I was thinking\nabout this in the context of this question of like, you know, these\nbeautiful kinds of ideas, you know? There's this amazing thing\nthat we found, and this is largely the work of Federico\nPagosi in my group. So a couple of years ago, we saw that\nnetworks of chemicals can learn. They have five or six different\nkinds of learning that they can do. And so what I asked them to do was to calculate the causal\nemergence of those networks while they're learning. And\nwhat I mean by that is this: If you're a rat, and you learn\nto press a lever and get a reward, there's no individual cell that had both experiences. The cells at\nyour paw had touched the lever. The cells in your gut got the delicious\nreward. No individual cell has both experiences. Who owns\nthat associative memory? Well, the rat. So that means you\nhave to be integrated, right? If you're going to learn associative memories\nfrom different parts, you have to be an integrated agent that can do that. And so\nwe can measure that now with metrics of causal emergence like fi and things like\nthat. So we know that in order to learn, you have to have significant fi.\nBut I wanted to ask the opposite question. What does learning do for\nyour fi level? Does it do anything for your degree of being an agent that\nis more than the sum of its parts? So we trained the networks, and sure enough,\nsome of them, not all of them, but some of them, as you train them, their fi goes up, okay? And so basically what we were able\nto find is that there is this positive feedback loop between every\ntime you learn something. ...you become more of an integrated agent. And\nevery time you do that, it becomes easier to learn. And so, it's this- - It's a virtuous cycle. - It's a virtuous cycle. It's an asymmetry\nthat points upwards for agency and intelligence. And now back to\nour platonic space stuff, where does that come from? It doesn't come from\nevolution. You don't need to have any evolution for this. Evolution will optimize the crap out of it,\nfor sure. But you don't need evolution to have this. It doesn't come from physics. It\ncomes from the rules of information, the causal information theory, and the behavior\nof networks. They're mathematical objects. It has, it's, this is not anything that, that was, you know, was, was\ngiven to you by physics or by a history of selection. It's a free gift from\nmath. And the free, and, and, and those two free gift, free gifts from\nmath lock together into a spiral that I think\ncauses simultaneously a rise in intelligence and a rise in\ncollective agency. And I think that's just, you know, that's been, you know,\njust, just amazing to think about. - Well, that free gift from ... I think\nis extremely useful in biology. When you have small entities forming networks, hierarchy that\nbuilds more and more complex organisms. That's, that's obvious. I mean,\nthis, this speaks to embryogenesis, which I, which I think is one of the\ncoolest things in the universe. Um, and i- in fact you acknowledge\nits coolness in ingressing mind's paper, writing, quote, \"Most\nof the big questions of philosophy are raised by the process of embryogenesis. Right in\nfront of our eyes, a single cell multiplies and\nself-assembles into a complex organism, with order on every scale of organization and adaptive\nbehavior. Each of us takes the same journey across\nthe Cartesian cut, starting off as a quiescent human oocyte, a little blob thought to be well-described\nby chemistry and physics. Gradually, it undergoes metamorphosis\nand eventually becomes a mature human with hopes, dreams, and a\nself-reflective metacognition that can enable it to describe itself as\na, not a machine, that's more than its brain, body, and underlying\nmolecular mechanisms,\" and so on. What, in all of our discussion,\ncan we say is the clear intuition how it's possible to take a leap from a single\ncell to a fully functioning organism full of dreams and hopes and friends\nand love and all that kind of stuff? In everything we've been talking\nabout, which has been a little bit technical, like how, how do we understand? Because\nthat's one of the most magical things the universe is able to\ncreate, perhaps the most magical. From simple physics and\nchemistry, create this, us two talking about ourselves. - I think we have to keep in mind\nthat physics and chemistry are not real things. They are\nlenses that we put on the world, that, that, they,\nthey are perspectives where we say, \"We are, for the time\nbeing, for the duration of this chemistry class or career or whatever,\nwe are going to put aside all the other levels, and we're going to\nfocus on this one level.\" And that what is fundamentally\ngoing on during that process is an amazing positive feedback\nloop of collective intelligence for the interface. It's the\nphysical interface that is scaling, it's the cognitive\nlight cone that it can support. So it's going from a molecular\nnetwork. The molecular network can already do things like Pavlovian conditioning. You\ndon't start with zero. When you have a simple molecular network, you are\nalready hosting some patterns from the platonic space that look like\nPavlovian conditioning. You've already got that starting out. That's just the molecular\nnetwork. Then you become a cell, and then you're many cells. And\nnow you're navigating anatomical amorphous space, and you're hosting all\nkinds of other patterns. And eventually you... And I think again, I think there's then\nthis is like what, you know, all this stuff that we're trying to work out now. There's\na consistent feedback between the ingressions you get and the ability\nto have new ones, which again, I think it's this positive feedback cycle, where\nthe more of these free gifts you pull down, they allow you physically to\ndevelop to ways where, \"Oh, look, now, now, now we're suitable for\nmore and higher ones.\" And this continuously goes and goes and goes until,\nyou know, until you're able to pull down a full human set of behavioral capacities. - What is the mechanism of such\nradical scaling of the cognitive cone? Is it just this kind of the\nsame thing that you were talking about with the network of\nchemicals being able to learn? - I'll give you two mechanisms that\nwe found. But again, just to be clear, these are mechanisms of the physical\ninterface. What we haven't gotten is a mature theory of how they map onto\nthe space, that's just beginning. But I will tell you what the\nphysical side of things look like. The first one has to do\nwith stress propagation. So imagine that you've got a bunch\nof cells, and there's a cell down here that needs to be up there. Okay. All of\nthese cells are exactly where they need to go, so they're happy, their stress\nis low. This cell... Now, this... Now, let's imagine stress is basically a It's a physical implementation\nof the error function. It's basically the amount of stress, it's basically\nthe delta between where you are now and where you need to be. Not necessarily in physical\nposition, this could be in anatomical space, in physiological space, and in\ntranscriptional space, whatever, right? It's just the delta from your set point.\nSo you're stressed out, but these guys are happy, they're not moving. You can't get\npast them. Now imagine if what you could do, is you could leak your stress, whatever your stress\nmolecule is, and the cool thing is that evolution has actually conserved these highly, so these are\nall... And we're studying all of these things, they're highly conserved. If you start leaking\nyour stress molecules, then all of this stuff around here is starting\nto get stressed out. When things get stressed, starting to get\nstressed out, their temperature in the... Not physical temperature, but in the sense\nof simulated annealing or something, right? Their plasticity goes up. Because they're\nfeeling stress, they need to relieve that stress, and because all the stress molecules\nare the same, they don't know it's not their stress. They are\nequally irritated by them as if it was their own stress, so they become a\nlittle more plastic. They become ready to kind of, you know, adopt different fates.\nYou get up to where you're going, and then everybody's stress can drop.\nSo notice what can happen by a very simple mechanism: just be leaky\nfor your own stress. My problems become your problems, not because you're\naltruistic, not because you actually care about my problems. There's no mechanism for you to actually\ncare about my problems, but just that simple mechanism means that faraway regions are now responsive\nto the needs of other regions, such that complex rearrangements and things\nlike that can happen. It's an alignment of everybody to the same goal through this\nvery dumb, simple stress-sharing thing. - via leaky stress. - Leaky stress, right? So\nthere's another one, which I call memory\nanonymization. So, imagine here are two cells. Imagine\nsomething happens to this cell, and it sends a signal over to this cell. Traditionally, you send a\nsignal over, this cell receives it. It's very clear that it came from\noutside, so this cell can do many things. It could ignore it, it could take on the information,\nit could just ignore it, it could reinterpret it, it could do whatever, but it's very\nclear that it came from outside. Now imagine the kind of thing that\nwe study, which is called gap junctions. These are electrical\nsynapses that could directly link the internal milieus of two cells. If\nsomething happens to this cell, it gets let's say it gets poked, and there's a\ncalcium spike or something, that propagates through the gap junction here,\nthis cell now has the same information, but this cell has no idea,\n\"Wait a minute, was that... is that my memory, or is that his memory?\" Because it's\nthe same, right? It's the same components, and so what you're able to\ndo now is to have a mind meld. You can have a mind meld between\nthe two cells where nobody's quite sure whose memory it is. When you\nshare memories like this, it's harder to say that I'm separate from you. If\nwe share the same memories, we are kind of a... and I don't mean every single memory,\nright? So they still have some identity, but to a large extent, they have a little bit\nof a mind meld, and there's many complexities you can lean on top of it. But what\nit means is that if you have a large group of cells, they now have joint memories of what happened to us, as opposed\nto, you know, what happened to you and I know what happened to me. That enables\na higher cognitive light cone, because you have greater computational\ncapacity, you have a greater area of concern, of things you want to manage. I\ndon't just want to manage my tiny, little memory states because I'm getting your memories.\nNow I know I've got to manage this whole thing. So both of these things end up\nscaling the size of things you care about, and that is a major ladder for\ncognition is to scale the degree of, you know, the size of concern that you have. - It'd be fascinating to be able\nto engineer that scaling. Probably applicable to AI systems. How\ndo you rapidly scale the cognitive cone? - Yeah, yeah. We have some collaborators... - Light cone. - in a company called Softmax that\nwe're working with to do some of that stuff in biology. That's our cancer\ntherapeutic, which is that what you see in cancer literally is cells electrically disconnect from their neighbors when they\nwere part of a giant memory that was working on making a nice organ. Now they\ncan't remember any of that. Now they're just amoebas, and the rest of the body is\njust external environment. And what we found is if you then\nphysically reconnect them to the network, you don't have to fix the\nDNA, you don't have to kill the cells with chemo. You can just reconnect them, and\nthey go back to— because they're now part of this larger collective—they go\nback to what they were working on. And so, yeah, I think we can\nintervene at that scale. - Let me ask you more\nexplicitly on the SETI, the Search for Unconventional Terrestrial Intelligence. What do you hope to do\nthere? How do you actually try to find unconventional intelligence all around\nus? First of all, do you think on Earth there is all kinds of incredible\nintelligence we haven't yet discovered? - I mean, guaranteed. We've already seen in our\nown bodies, and I don't just mean that we are host to a bunch of microbiome\nor any of that. I mean, your cells and—we have all\nkinds of footwork on this— every day they traverse these alien spaces, 20,000-dimensional spaces,\nand other spaces. They solve problems. I think they suffer when\nthey fail to meet their goals. They suffer when they fail to meet\ntheir goals, they have stress reduction when they meet their goals. These\nthings are inside of us. They are all around us. I think that we are, we have an\nincredible degree of mind blindness to all of the very alien kinds\nof minds around us. And I think that, you know, looking for aliens\noff Earth is awesome and whatever. But if we can't recognize the\nones that are inside our own bodies, what chance do we\nhave to really— you know, to really recognize the\nones that are out there? - Do you think there could\nbe a measure like IQ for mind? What would it be?\nNot mindedness, but intelligence that's broadly\napplicable to the unconventional minds, that's generalizable\nto unconventional minds, where we could even\nquantify, like, \"Holy shit, this discovery is incredible\nbecause it has this IQ\"? - Yeah, yes and no. The yes part is that as we have shown, you can take\nexisting IQ metrics—I mean, literally existing kinds of\nways that people use to measure intelligence of animals and humans and whatever,\nand you can apply them to very weird things. If you have the imagination to\nmake the interface, you can do it. And we've done it, and\nwe've shown creative— —problem-solving and all\nthis kind of stuff. So, yes. However, we have to be humble about these\nthings and recognize that all of those IQ metrics that we've come up with so far were derived from an N of one\nexample of the evolutionary lineage here on Earth, and so we\nare probably missing a lot of them. So I would say we have plenty to start.\nWe have so much to start with. We could keep tens of thousands of\npeople busy just testing things now, but we have to be aware that we're\nprobably missing a lot of important ones. - Well, what do you think has more interesting,\nintelligent, unconventional minds inside our body, the human body, or like we were talking off-mic, the Amazon jungle,\nlike nature, natural systems outside of? Like the sophisticated biological\nsystems we're aware of? - Yeah. We don't know, because it's\nreally hard to do experiments on larger systems. It's a lot easier to go\ndown than it is to go up. But my suspicion is, you know,\nlike the Buddhists say, innumerable sentient beings, I think by the\ntime you get to that degree of infinity, it kinda doesn't matter to compare. I suspect\nthere are just massive numbers of them. - Yeah, I think it really matters which\nkinds of systems are amenable to our current methods of scientific inquiry. I mean, I spent quite a lot\nof hours just staring at ants when I was in the Amazon, and\nit's such a mysterious, wonderful collective intelligence. I don't\nknow how amenable it is to research. I've seen some folks\ntry. You can simulate. You can but I feel like we're missing a lot. - I'm sure we are, but one of my favorite\nthings about that kind of work, have you seen there's at least three or\nfour papers showing that ant colonies fall for the same visual\nillusions that we fall for? Not the ants, the colonies. So, if you... - The colony together. Yeah. - the colonies. So if you... lay out food in particular patterns, they'll do\nthings like complete lines that aren't there and... And like all the same shit\nthat we fall for, they fall for. So I don't think it's hopeless, but I do think\nthat we need a lot of work to develop tools. - Do you think all of the tooling that we\ndevelop and the mapping that we've been discussing will help us do the study\npart, finding aliens out there? - I think it's essential. I think\nit's essential. We are so parochial in what we expect to\nfind in terms of life, that we are going to be just\ncompletely missing a lot of stuff. If we can't even, if we\ncan't even agree on, never mind definitions of life, but, you know, what's actually important. I read a paper recently\nwhere they asked about 65 or so modern working scientists for a\ndefinition of life. And we had so many different\ndefinitions across so many different dimensions. We had to use\nAI to make amorphous space out of it. And there was zero consensus about\nwhat actually is important, you know? And if we're not good at recognizing it\nhere, I just don't see how we're going to be good at recognizing it somewhere else. - So, given how miraculous\nlife is here on Earth, it's clear to me that we have\nso much more work to do. That said, would that be\nexciting to you if we find life on other planets in the\nsolar system? Like, what would you do with that information?\nOr is that just another life form that we don't understand? - I would be very excited about it\nbecause it would give us some more unconventional\nembodiments to think about. Right? A data point that's pretty far\naway from our existing data points, at least in this solar system.\nSo that would be cool. I'd be very excited about it.\nBut I must admit that my level of surprise has been pushed\nso high at this point that it would have to... you know, it\nwould have to be something really weird to make me shocked. I mean, the things\nthat we see every day is just, uh, - I think you've mentioned\nin a few places that you wrote that the \"Ingressing\nMinds\" paper is not the weirdest thing you plan to write. How\nweird are you gonna get? Maybe a better question\nis, in which direction of weirdness do you think\nyou will go in your life? In which direction of the weird\nOverton window are you going to expand? - Yeah. Well, the background\nto this is simply that I've had a lot of weird ideas for many,\nmany decades, and my general policy is not to talk about stuff\nuntil it becomes actionable. And the amazing thing,\nI'm really just kind of shocked is that in my\nlifetime, the empirical work, I really didn't think we\nwould get this far. And the knob, I have this mental knob\nof what percentage of the weird things I think do I actually\nsay in public, right? And every few years when the empirical work moves forward, I sort of turn that\nknob a little, right, as we keep going. So I have no idea if we'll continue to be that\nfortunate or how long I can keep doing this or however, like, I don't know.\nBut just to give you, um, and just to give you a\ndirection for it, it's going to be in the direction of\nwhat kinds of things do we need to take seriously\nas other beings with which to relate to. So I've already\npushed it, you know, so like, we knew brainy things, and then we\nsaid, \"Well, it's not just brains.\" And then we said, \"Well, it's not\njust...\" So, you know, it's not just in physical space, and it's not just\nbiologicals, and it's not just complexity. There are a couple of other\nsteps to take that I'm pretty sure are there, but we're gonna have to do the actual work to make it actionable\nbefore, you know, before we really talk about it. So that direction. - I think it's fair to say you're one\nof the more unconventional humans, scientists out there. So the interesting question is, what's your process of idea\ngeneration? What's your process of discovery? You've done a lot of really incredibly interesting, like you said,\nactionable, but interesting, out there ideas that you've actually\nengineered with Xenobots and Anthrobots, these kinds\nof things. Like, what... When you go home tonight,\ngo to the lab, what's the process, empty sheet of paper,\nwhen you're thinking through it? - Well, the mental part is, a lot of it much like, funny enough, much like\nmaking Xenobots. You know, we make Xenobots by releasing constraints, right?\nWe don't do anything to them. We just release them from the constraints\nthey already have, and then we see- So a lot of it is releasing\nthe constraints that mentally have been placed on us. And part of\nit is my education has been a little weird 'cause I was a computer scientist\nfirst, and only later biology. So by the time I heard all the biology things that we typically just take on\nboard, I was already a little skeptical and thinking a\nlittle differently. But a lot of it comes from releasing constraints.\nI very specifically think about, okay, this is what we know. What would\nthings look like if we were wrong? Or what would it look like if I was wrong?\nWhat are we missing? What is our worldview specifically not able to see, right?\nWhatever model I have. Or another way I often think is I'll take two things that\nare considered to be very different things, and I'll say, \"Let's just\nimagine those as two points on a continuum.\" What does that look like? What\ndoes the middle of that continuum look like? What's the symmetry there?\nWhat's the parameter that I can you know, what's the knob I can turn to get from here to there? So those\nkinds of... I look for symmetries a lot. I'm like, okay, this thing is like that\nway, in what way? What's the fewest number of things I would have to move to\nmake this map onto that? Right? So these are, you know, those are kind of\nmental tools. The physical process for me is basically, I mean, obviously I'm fortunate to have a lot of discussions\nwith very smart people. So in my group, there are some, you know, I've hired some amazing\npeople, so we of course have a lot of discussions and some stuff comes out\nof that. My process is I do pretty much every\nmorning, or I'm outside for sunrise, and I walk\naround in nature. There's just not really anything\nbetter as inspiration, right? Than nature. I do photography, and I find that it's a good meditative\ntool because it keeps your hands and brain just busy enough. Like, you don't have to\nthink too much, but you know, you're sort of twiddling and looking and doing some\nstuff, and it keeps your brain off of the linear, like logical, like careful train\nof thought enough to release it so that you can ideate a little\nmore while your hands are busy. - So it's not even the thing you're\nphotographing, it's the mechanical process of doing the photography. - and mentally, right? Because I'm not walking\naround thinking, \"Okay, let's see, so for this experiment, we gotta, you know, I gotta\nget this piece of equipment and this...\" Like, that goes away, and it's like, okay, what's the\nlighting and what's the... What am I looking at? And during that time when you're\nnot thinking about that other stuff, then I say, \"Well, yeah, I gotta get a... I\ngot a notebook,\" and I'm like, \"Look, this is what we need to do.\"\nSo that kind of stuff. - And the actual idea writing down\nstuff, is it notebook? Is it computer? Are you super\norganized, thinking or is it just like random words\nhere and there with drawings, and... Like, what... And also, what is the space of thoughts you\nhave in your head? Is this sort of amorphous, things that\naren't very clear? Are you visualizing stuff? Is there\nsomething you can articulate there? - I tend to leave myself\na lot of voicemails. Because as I'm walking around, I'm like,\n\"Oh man, this idea,\" and so I'll just call my office and leave myself a\nvoicemail for later to transcribe. - Nice. - I don't have a good enough memory to remember\nany of these things, and so what I keep is a mind map. So I have an\nenormous mind map. One piece of it hangs in my lab so that people can\nsee, \"These are the ideas, this is how they link together. Here's everybody's project.\nI'm working on this. How does this attach to everybody else's so they can track it?\" The thing\nthat hangs in the lab is about nine feet wide. It's a silk sheet, and it's out\nof date within a couple of weeks of my printing it, because new\nstuff keeps moving around. Um, and then there's more that\nisn't for anybody else's view. But yeah, I try to be very organized because otherwise,\nI forget. So everything is in the mind map. Things are in manuscripts.\nI have something like, right now, probably 163, 62 open manuscripts that are in the process of being written at various\nstages. And when things come up, I stick them in the right manuscript, in the right\nplace, so that when I'm finally ready to finalize, then I'll put words around it and whatever.\nBut there are outlines of everything. So I try- - Ah - ...to be organized, because I\ncan't... I don't have the, you know? - So there's a wide front of manuscripts of work that's being\ndone, and it's continuously pushing towards completion,\nbut you're not clear where... what's going to be\nfinished when and how and - That- - When is the actual- - That's... I mean, that's... Yes,\nbut that's just the theoretical, philosophical stuff. The empirical work\nthat we're doing in the lab, I mean, those are... We know exactly, you know- - It's more focused. There's a\nspecific set of questions. - Like, we know this is, this is, you know,\nanthrobot aging. This is limb regeneration. This is the new cancer paper. This is\nwhatever. Yeah, those things are very linear. - Where do you think ideas come\nfrom when you're taking a walk that eventually materialize\nin a voicemail? Where's that? What... Is that from\nyou? You know, a lot of really some of the most interesting people feel\nlike they're channeling from somewhere else. - I mean, I hate to bring up the Platonic\nspace again, but I mean, if you talk to any creative, that's basically what\nthey'll tell you, right? And certainly that's been my experience,\nso I feel like it's a... The way, the way it feels to me is a\ncollaboration. So collaboration is I need to bust my ass and be prepped\nin one... A, to work hard, to be able to recognize the idea when it comes, and B,\nto actually have an outlet for it so that when it does come, we have a lab and\nwe have people who can help me do it, and then we can actually get it out, right?\nSo that's my part, is, you know, be, be, be up at 4:30 AM doing your\nthing and be ready for it. But the other side of the collaboration is\nthat, yeah, when you do that, like, amazing ideas come, and, you know, to say that it's\nme I don't think would be, would be right. I... you know, I think it's, it's\ndefinitely coming from, from other places. - What advice would you give to scientists, PhD\nstudents, grad students, young scientists that are trying to explore\nthe space of ideas given the very unconventional,\nnon-standard, unique set of ideas you've explored\nin your life and career? - Um, let's see. Well, the first and\nmost important thing I've learned is not to take too much advice, and\nso I don't like to give too much advice. But I do have one\ntechnique that I've found very useful, and this isn't for everybody,\nbut there's a specific demographic. There's a lot of unconventional\npeople reach out to me, and I try to respond and, and help them and so on. This\nis a technique that I think is useful for some people. How do I\ndescribe it? You need to, uh, it's the act of bifurcating\nyour mind, and you need to have two different regions. One\nregion is the practical region of impact. In\nother words, how do I get my idea out into the world so\nthat other people recognize it? What should I say? What are people hearing?\nWhat are they able to hear? How do I pivot it? What parts do I not talk\nabout? Which journal am I going to publish this in? Is it time now? Do I\nwait two years for this? Like, all the practical stuff that is all about how\nit looks from the outside, right? All the stuff that I can't say this\nor I should say this differently, or this is going to freak people out, or\nthis is odd. You know, this community wants to hear this so I can pivot it this\nway. Like, all that practical stuff. It's got to be there; otherwise, you're not going\nto be in a position to follow up any of your ideas. You're not going to have a career. You can't...\nyou're not going to have resources to do anything. But it's very important that that can't be the only thing. You need\nanother part of your mind that ignores all that shit completely, because this other part of\nyour mind has to be pure. It has to be I don't care what anybody else thinks about\nthis. I don't care whether this is publishable, describable. I don't care if anybody gets it. I don't\ncare if anybody thinks it's stupid. This is what I think, and why, and give\nit space to, to sort of grow, right? And if you keep the... if you try to mush them...\nIf you try to mush them together, I found that impossible because, because the\npractical stuff poisons the other stuff. If you're too much on the creative\nend, you can be an amazing thinker, it's just nothing ever materializes. But\nif you're very practical, it tends to poison the other stuff because\nthe more you think about how to present things so that\nother people get it, it, it constrains and it bends\nhow you start to think. And, you know what I tell my students and others is there's two kinds\nof advice. There's very practical, specific things, like somebody\nsays, \"Well, you forgot this control,\" or, \"This isn't the right method,\"\nor, \"You shouldn't be...\" That stuff is gold, and you should take that very seriously,\nand you should use it to improve your craft, right? And that's, like, super important. But then there's\nthe meta advice where people are like, \"That's not a good way to think about it.\nDon't work on this. This isn't...\" This isn't...\" That stuff is garbage.\nAnd even very successful people often give very constraining, terrible advice.\nLike, one of my reviewers in the paper years ago said... I love this. The Freudian\nslip. He said he was going to give me constrictive criticism, right? And\nthat's exactly what he gave me. - That's funny. - It was constrictive criticism. I was like,\n\"That's awesome.\" That's a great typo. - Well, it's very true. I mean, the\nbifurcation of the mind is beautifully put. I do think some of the most\ninteresting people I've met are sometimes fall short on the normie side, on the\npractical, \"How do I... Having the emotional intelligence of how do I\ncommunicate this with people that have a very different worldview,\nthat are more conservative and more conventional and\nmore kind of fit into the norm.\" You have to be able to have the\nskill to fit in. And then you have to Again, beautifully put, be able to\nshut that off when you go on your own and think. And having two\nskills is very important. I think a lot of radical thinkers think\nthat they're sacrificing something by learning the skill of fitting\nin, but I think if you want to have impact, if you want ideas to\nresonate and actually lead to, first of all, be able\nto build great teams, that help bring your ideas to life. And\nsecond of all, for your ideas to have impact, and to scale, and to resonate with a large number of people,\nyou have to have that skill. And those are very different.\nThose are very different. Let me ask a ridiculous question.\nYou already spoke about it, but what to you is one of the most\nbeautiful ideas that you've encountered in your various\nexplorations? Maybe not just beautiful, but one that makes you happy\nto be a scientist, to be able to be a- curious human exploring ideas. - I mean, I must say that, you\nknow, I sometimes think about, these ingressions from this space as a kind of steganography, you\nknow? So steganography is when you hide data and messages within the bits of\nanother pattern that don't matter, right? bits of another pattern\nthat don't matter, right? And the rule of steganography is you\ncan't mess up the main thing, you know? So if it's a picture of a cat or whatever,\nyou got to keep the cat. But if there's bits that don't matter, you can kind of stick\nstuff. So I feel like all these ingressions are a kind of universal steganography, that\nthere's these patterns seep into everything, everywhere they can. And\nthey're kind of, they're kind of shy, meaning that they're very\nsubtle, not invisible. If you work hard, you can catch them. But they're not\ninvisible, but they're hard to see. And the fact that I think they also affect, quote unquote, machines\nas much as they certainly affect living organisms, I think\nis incredibly beautiful. beautiful. And I personally am happy\nto be part of that same spectrum, and the fact that that- that magic is sort of applicable to everything. A lot\nof people find that extremely disturbing, and that's some of the hate\nmail I get. It's like, \"Yeah, we were with you on the majesty of life thing until you got\nto the fact that machines get it too.\" And now, like, terrible, right?\nYou're kind of devaluing the majesty of life. And I don't know. The idea that we're now catching\nthese patterns and we're able to do meaningful research on\nthe interfaces and all that is just, to me, absolutely beautiful. And that-\nthat it's all one spectrum, I think to me is- is amazing. I'm enriched by it. - I agree with you. I think it's incredibly\nbeautiful. I lied, there's an even more ridiculous question. So, it- it seems like we are progressing towards\npossibly creating a superintelligent system an AGI, an ASI. If I had one, gave it to you,\nput you in the room, what would be the first question you ask it? Maybe the\nfirst set of questions? Like, there's so many topics that you've worked on and\nare interested in, what ... Is there like a first question that you really\njust, if you can get an answer, solid answer, what would it be? - I mean, the first thing I would ask is how much should I even be talking\nto you? For sure. Because it's not clear to me at all that\ngetting somebody to tell you an answer in the long run is\noptimal. It's the difference between when you're a kid learning math\nand having an older sibling that'll just- tell you the answers, right? Like, sometimes\nit's like, \"Come on, just give me the answer. Let's move on with this cancer\nprotocol and whatever.\" Like, great. But in the long run, the\nprocess of discovering it yourself, how much of that\nare we willing to give up? And by getting a final answer,\nhow much have we missed of stuff we might've found along the way? Now,\nI don't know what. The thing is, I-I... You know, I don't think it's correct\nto say, \"Don't do that at all. You know, take the time in all the blind\nalleys.\" That may not be optimal either, but we don't know what the optimal\nis. We don't know how much we should be stumbling around versus having\nsomebody tell us the answer. - That's actually a brilliant\nquestion to ask AGI then. - It, I mean, if it's really... - That's a really... - If it's really an AGI. - I mean, that's a good first question. - Yeah, if it's really an AGI, I'm like, \"Tell me what the\nbalance is. Like, how much should I be talking to you versus stumbling around in the lab and\nmaking all my own mistakes?\" And was it 70/30? You know, 10/90? I don't\nknow. So that would be the first... - And then the AGI will say, \"You\nshouldn't be talking to me.\" - It may well be. It may say, \"What the hell\ndid you make me for in the first place? You guys are screwed.\"\nLike, that's possible. Um, You know, the second question I would\nask is, \"What's the answer I should be? What's the question I should be asking you\nthat I probably am not smart enough to ask you?\" That's the other thing I would say. - This is really complicated. That's\na really, really strong question. But again, there the answer might be You wouldn't understand the question it\nproposes, most likely. So I think for- Me, I would probably, assuming you can\nget a lot of questions, I would probably go for questions where I would understand the answer. It would uncover\nsome small mystery that I'm super curious about. Because if you ask big questions\nlike you did, which are really strong questions, I just feel\nlike I wouldn't understand the answer. If you ask it, \"What question should I be\nasking you?\" It would probably say something like, \"What is the shape of the universe?\" And you're like,\n\"What? Why is that important?\" You- You would be very confused by the question\nit proposes. I would probably want to It would just be nice for me to\nknow, straight up, first question, how many living intelligent alien\ncivilizations are in the observable universe? Yeah, that would just be nice. To know if it is zero or is it a\nlot? I just want to know that. Unfortunately, it might answer. It\nmight be a Michael Levin answer. \"Give me a\"- a Michael Levin answer. - That's what I was about to say, is that my guess\nis it's going to be exactly the problem you said, which is it's going to say, \"Oh my God.\nI mean, right in this room, you got-\" You know, and like, \"Oh, man.\" - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everything\nyou need to know about alien civilizations is right here in this room.\nIn fact, it's inside your own body. - Just for starters. - Thank you- - ... for starters - AGI. Thank you. All right, Michael.\nOne of my favorite scientists, one of my favorite humans. Thank you\nfor everything you do in this world. - Thank you so much. - Truly, truly fascinating work,\nand keep going for all of us. - Thank you- - You're an inspiration. - So much. Thank you so much.\nIt's great to see you. Always a good discussion. Thank\nyou so much, I appreciate it. - Thank you for this. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening to this conversation\nwith Michael Levin.
