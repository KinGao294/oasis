  "full_text": "- You said that Red Dead Redemption 2, in\nyour opinion, is the best thing you've ever done. I think there's a strong case to be\nmade that it's the greatest game of all time. What are the elements that make that\ngame truly great, do you think? - People searching for meaning amongst\nthe violence. I think that the West and all the themes around the\nWest really lend itself to that. And the gunplay was fantastic, and the\nhorses were incredible. I think we got to spend, a smaller group of\nus, working on it from day one, coming up with some weird, wacky ideas that we got to embed in the game. It\nwas helpful that we got to be very creative before it had a full team on it. - You lock yourself in a room and get\nanchovies and onion pizza and crushed... Diet Cokes? - Yes. - Is this accurate information? - Very accurate. - Why do you think there was so much excitement\nabout GTA IV, GTA V, and now GTA VI? - I think we did a really good job of\nconstantly innovating. The games always felt different. People have very\nstrong feelings: \"I like this one.\" \"I didn't like that one as much,\"\nbecause they are pretty different. So you know what's going to happen. It's a\nGrand Theft Auto, you know it's going to be a game about being a criminal, but the way it's\ngoing to be a game is going to change quite a lot. - The number one question from the\ninternet, it is so ridiculous, but I must ask, \"Have you seen Gavin?\" The following\nis a conversation with Dan Houser, a legendary video game creator,\nco-founder of Rockstar Games, and the creative force behind Grand Theft\nAuto and Red Dead Redemption series, which includes some of the\nbest-selling games of all time and some of the greatest\ngames of all time. Both Red Dead Redemption\n1 and 2 have some of the deepest, most complex, and\nheart-wrenching characters and storylines ever created in video games. Dan has started a new\ncompany, Absurdventures, great name, that is creating\nsome incredible new worlds in multiple forms, including books,\ncomic books, audio series, and yes, video games. That includes A Better Paradise, which is a dystopian\nnear-future world with a super intelligent AI,\nAmerican Caper, which is an insanely chaotic,\nviolent, dark, satirical world, and Absurdiverse,\nwhich is a comedic action-adventure world. I'm excited to\nexplore all three of these. I have spent hundreds of hours in worlds that\nDan has helped create, so this conversation was an incredible\nhonor for me. And on top of that, Dan and I talked a lot\nafter and in the days since, and he has been just a\nwonderful human being. I'm just at a loss of\nwords. I feel like the luckiest kid in the world.\nThis is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check\nout our sponsors in the description, where you can also find links\nto contact me, ask questions, give feedback, and so on. And now,\ndear friends, here's Dan Houser. You've helped create some of the most\nincredible characters, stories, and open worlds in video game\nhistory. But when you grew up in the late '70s and '80s,\nopen-world video games wasn't a thing. So you've\ncredited literature and film as early inspiration. So let's\ntalk about film first, if we can. - Sure. - What to you are some of the candidates\nfor the greatest films of all time, maybe films that were highly\ninfluential on you? I mean, Godfather. - God, well, I think for me, probably Godfather II\nmore than Godfather I, but I love both of them. But I love the divided story in Godfather II. And as a migrant,\nI used to live in Soho. I love the bits in\nLittle Italy, and I love the sections in Sicily. I\nthink and the bit, Ellis Island is just one of the\nbest shots in all of cinema. When you see little Vito turning up in\nEllis Island and you get that shot, it's amazing. It gives you a really good\ncinematic sense of what it must have been like to arrive in America. - How much of the greatness of\nGodfather do you think is the writing? How much is the cinematography\nand how much is the acting? You got De Niro, you got young Pacino. - Coppola started as a screenwriter, so\nI think he wrote, at least co-wrote the script. So it's almost like the writing,\ndirecting almost become the same thing. But it's one of those films, both of them\nare those films, which I was thinking about this idea of a perfect film\nwhere everything's good. Where the acting's seminal, where the\nwriting's seminal, where the music is seminal, where the shots are so\nmemorable, where the scenes you know, define what you think about things.\nIt's impossible to think about the mafia and not think about The Godfather. - What about the pacing? It is a bit\nslow. You have movies like 2001 Space Odyssey, slow. - Yes. - It used to be, back in my\nday, it used to be slow. - Life got faster. Life just got, you know,\nas I think as we moved from the '70s into the '80s, into the '90s,\npeople had seen so many films, they just started to edit films faster.\nAnd people understood cinematic storytelling so much that you\ncould do things much quicker, you could show a look and just that\nmeant you realized that person was gonna betray the other person. They\njust edited films much quicker. But I quite like the slowness. I think\nthese days with modern, you know, high quality televisions, you don't have to\nnecessarily watch these films in one sitting, particularly when you're rewatching them. So it\ndoesn't bother me that they're long and slow. - Speaking of faster, life\ngetting faster, I... I'm sure another influential movie was\nGoodfellas, Scorsese. That's faster, right? - Yes. - A mixture of crime and humor. - And almost like an open world game in\nsome ways, in that it's this slice of life. You know, I think that probably\nchanged cinema at the tail end of the '80s, changed cinema at the sort\nof tail end of the '80s, early '90s, more than any\nother film. And it's so iconic. In some ways I prefer\nCasino, but the invention is really in Goodfellas. I love the\nend of Casino, you know, the use of voiceover, the way you saw\nthem being criminals and being normal people, you know, it changed\neverything. The Sopranos is obviously completely inspired by Goodfellas. - Casino has, first of all, the character\nof Sharon Stone. I mean, everything. - The look, the clothes... ...The music. - I would say one of the most\nmemorable moments in film for me is the meeting in the desert. I mean, just\nthe drama building up to that between... - Dig another hole. - Yeah. The environment, the city,\nspeaking of open world and creating a character from the city. It's\none of the great Vegas films. - I think the great Vegas film. There\nare bits that I always... that I love. At the end, when everything's\nwrapping up, and on the one hand you see the Robert De Niro character,\nhe's still good at making money, so they let him return to normal life. But then\nyou get that brilliant scene when all of the, the mob bosses from back\nhome, they're discussing all these people who may or may not be\nable to implicate them. And then there's that incredibly cold line where one of\nthem, they're thinking about the old, you know, I think it's the casino manager, and one\nof them just goes, \"Ah, the way I see it, why take a chance?\" And then the next thing, he's\njust shot. The brutality of it all is just brilliant. - I don't know, I probably have to disagree with\nyou on Vegas. There's at least some competitors. You got what, Nicolas Cage Leaving Las\nVegas? I mean, falling in love with a prostitute. You've written some\nof the great crime stories ever. - Thank you. - And in some sense, there's love stories\nin there. And you've talked about- ...being a bit of a romantic yourself. Appreciating the depth of love\nstories in literature at the very least. And there is a dark\nkind of love story between an alcoholic and a prostitute.\nHe got an Oscar for that. - I think he did for that, didn't he? - Plus there's the caricature of the\ndrug world of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. That's an interesting one. - I love the book so much. I was obsessed\nby it when I was about 17, 18. And I enjoyed the film,\nbut I preferred the book. - Has a Hunter S. Thompson type of character\never made it into any of your stories? - No, but one of the things we're\nworking on now, there's sort of an English version of Hunter\nS. Thompson if he was also a market gardener. I love\nthat persona. But he's kind of... it's hard. If you make him American,\nit's hard for it not just to be Hunter S. Thompson. - Is this an American caper? - No, it's in this animated\nshow we're developing in this sort of comedy world we're working on called\nAbsurdiverse, and it's in one of the stories in that. - What is Absurdiverse? - Absurdiverse is a comedy universe we're developing that\nwill be an open-world video game and then some loosely adjacent\nstories that we're going to make as animated TV shows or possibly animated\nmovies. We're still thinking that all through. And we're building\nthe game up in San Rafael at the moment, and it's\nearly days, but it's looking very exciting. And it's trying to be... like,\ntrying to make a game that feels a a little bit like a living sitcom. - Is there some drama and tragedy at\nthe edges, or is it pure comedy? - I hope it's got comedy, cynicism, heart,\ndrama, and some amusing life lessons. Otherwise, you can't just have\njokes for 40 hours, it won't work. - Okay, so comedy needs some darkness. - Well, I think it needs story. One of\nmy favorite comedies of this century is The Office because it was incredibly\nfunny, but also because it had narrative and heart underneath the cynicism. I\nthink with narrative, you get a drive alongside jokes. - And there's going to be\nan open-world video game. - Yes. Yes. - When? - Two, three, four years.\nStill thinking that through. - So, what's the process of getting from\nthe idea to the end of a video game? Why does it take so long to get it right? - That's an interesting question. I think if\nyou look at the scale at which they're built, you could argue it the other way, why\nis it so quick? I mean, you really are building, in one go, a world, a city, and\n40 hours of entertainment cut through it. and 40 hours of entertainment cut\nthrough it. You know, these things are massive four-dimensional mosaics that are\nintensely complicated and have to work in lots of different ways. And I think\nthat's us being kind of aggressive on the timeline. - We're taking a tangent upon\na tangent upon a tangent, but I have to return to some films. Let\nme just list a few of my favorites. So first of all, you said\nyou love great war books. - Yes. - and movies. - Yes. - So we have to throw in Platoon from Oliver\nStone and Apocalypse Now, for me at least. - Of course. - There's more crime,\nfast-moving crime movies, like Scarface. I also love True Romance. - I love True Romance. Possibly the best,\none of the best scripts ever written. - Written, of course, by Quentin Tarantino. What do you love about True Romance?\nI think sometimes, depending on the day, depending on the bar and how\nmuch alcohol I've had, I will say True Romance is the best movie ever made. - Yeah, I mean, True Romance is super fun.\nTony Scott was a really good director, so it moves at a really good speed. It's\nfunny, it's completely unbelievable, but you really care about the characters.\nIt's the kind of, you know, this world that obviously doesn't exist, but you\nfeel it does exist. The characters are larger than life. The dialogue is\nunbelievable. You could just sit and watch unbelievable. You could just sit and watch\nthem talk all day long. And, you know, you just... it's amusing. You just want to\nlive in that world. I was thinking about, like, what do you like about films? It's\nthe idea to be in a world. You want to... they're not real. They're never real,\nbut you want to be in these fake worlds that people have invented. - And I think you said that what makes a\ngreat world is having a large cast of characters. And I think that movie is a\ngood example. I mean, you have Christopher Walken with the sort of legendary\nsuper racist discussion. - Yeah. Rant. - Rant. - Dennis Hopper is just sort of a dream dad. - Yeah. Dream dad. And just that interaction is\nlegendary. You got even Brad Pitt as a pothead on the couch. - Gary Oldman. - Gary Oldman. - As a rasta. - Yeah, and you have... I\nmean, a real love story. Like, a real, genuine, pure love\ncan survive in any context. - And it's just sweet. Their love\nstory is very sweet in that film. - Yeah. - It's endearing. - The... Elvis is a character.\nIt's kind of like a mini GTA type game. Some of the same\nbeauty, the comedy, the love, the- - Yeah, and it's all crossed with Play It\nAgain, Sam. It sort of feels a bit like that with the Elvis character. - What about greatest war film?\nWhat would it be for you? - Greatest war film? If I'm\nfeeling serious, it would be a Russian film called Come and See. which is probably the most intense\nfilm ever made. And if I'm feeling slightly less serious,\nApocalypse Now, and I would always want to watch the original cut.\nI don't prefer the re-edits. I like the original first release. I think it's\ntighter and slicker and works the best. - Yeah, of course, Apocalypse Now is this\nhallucinatory journey into darkness, I think, madness. - Yeah, but from your first- - Yeah - scene onwards, it's just got these\namazing set piece after set piece and, again, incredible\ncharacters, brilliant dialogue. - Some of the greatest films about war\nreveal that war is not what it seems, and there's different ways of doing that.\nAnd you've talked about different books. The Thin Red Line is another book—\n...and movie that shows that. - Yeah, yeah, and I watched the movie\nyears before I read the book, and I didn't understand the movie. And then I read the book,\nand I read a lot about the editing of the movie, and I understood\nwhy I didn't understand the movie, and that's 'cause the movie makes no sense.\nIt is beautifully shot, and the music is one of the best film scores of all\ntime. But they edited two different battle scenes into one battle in a way that\nthey're spread apart by ages in the book to assemble... I think they filmed the book\npretty much verbatim. It would've been as a six-hour movie, then edited this impressionistic\nthing that's incredibly beautiful but doesn't necessarily make\nnarrative sense at the end of it. But it's still very beautiful, the film. - And in terms of Westerns, what's the\ngreatest? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Unforgiven? Those are\nfor me, maybe even Django Unchained. You've mentioned Butch\nCassidy and the Sundance Kid. - I think for me it's two films from, I\nthink, pretty much the same year, Butch Cassidy and The Wild Bunch. - I love Robert Redford. Rest in peace. - That film, it's just impossible to imagine\nany buddy film without Butch Cassidy. - It's Paul Newman, Robert Redford,\nand Clint Eastwood for you, also? Has that impacted your\nwriting on Red Dead? - I love Unforgiven, but the truth is with Red Dead, I'd seen a lot of Westerns\nas a kid. My dad watched lots of Westerns. They were always on\nTV. You know, I felt I knew a lot, quite a bit about Westerns. And then, you know, then I had to start\nthinking about writing one for work. And I deliberately did not binge on\nWesterns. I tried to watch no more Westerns and just think about what I liked\nabout them, what I didn't like about them, what would be a take that\nwould work today and would work within the confines of\na game. And I think Red Dead 1 was a slightly more traditional\nWestern. And then having done that, tried to take Red Dead 2 in a different direction so that it felt\nlike a worthy successor. Didn't just feel like more of the same. - From movies to video games,\nwhen did you first fall in love with video games? Literature\nwas the first love. - No, films. - Films. - Films was always, well, what I\nloved first as a kid was films. Um, older... Began reading books properly aged about eight. Was\nwatching films long before that. - Nice. - And then probably it was always bouncing\nbetween the two, which I preferred. I think they're good at\ndifferent things. Games, I played and, above all, watched a lot\nof games as a kid, as being a young kid, you know, other people playing\nthem. Um, and I obviously liked the core thing games do, which is\nyou press a button and something happens. They're responsive,\nthey're alive, and that's captivating. And then the competitive\nangle of games is fun, or you know, beating this, beating that,\nwinning this. That was fun as well. Sometimes obsessively so. You know,\nI remember being completely addicted at one point when I should've been\nstudying, for months at a time, to Tetris on a Game Boy. You know, I liked\ngames and I liked interactivity and I liked the movement to this digital\nworld that's really emerged for me pretty much as soon as I\nleft college. But I didn't love it. And then I really\nfell in love with games when I was properly making them,\nprobably as late as like 2001. - Oh, wow. - And when I suddenly began to see...\nFirst of all, my mind, you know, that's a whole nother story, but just suddenly saw what they could do\nand could be and what this chance was to be one of the\npeople involved in making these things that was this, you\nknow, where you were really kind of breaking trail into the future, it felt like. And\nI think that was when I really went, \"These are amazing.\" And that's when I really\nfell in love with... I could see it in moments and suddenly you could make this whole\nexperience. So that was really the moment for me. - Yeah, of course, because you were\na pioneer of open-world games that are so narrative-driven. So it's like\nyou didn't have too many examples. - Yeah, before that it\nwas PS1 or even before that. Games looked terrible.\nYou know, you would be like it's eight pixels, it's a car. You know,\nit was not a car. They just didn't... It was always you were squinting and\nclosing both your eyes and trying to imagine it was this thing you were told it\nwas. And all they were about, you know, very surreal subject matter 'cause\nyou couldn't make them remotely real. And suddenly we were able to build\nthese experiences where you could run a simulation of a city and\nit was in three dimensions and it felt alive. And we\nwere trying to give it even more, at least the illusion of even\nmore life. And yet you see you could tell a story in three or, you\nknow, using time, in four dimensions, and that felt very inspiring. - Yeah, I think GTA III is probably one of the most influential\ngames of all time. It created a feeling of an open world. What do\nyou think it takes to create that feeling? There were like these looming skyscrapers. There were the changing\ntraffic lights. There's the feeling like, first of all, you had a\nfeeling you could do anything, and then the world was reacting to it. - Yes - in a way that didn't feel scripted. - Yes, and it wasn't scripted.\nIt was really, really, really low-rent AI. It was a\nsimulation that you could prod and push and see what\nhappened, and I think that was incredibly... It was two\nthings. It was the fact that here was a simulation that you could mess\nabout with and the simulation seemed to have a personality. So you could\npush and see... And the world would push you back in whatever way that\nmeant. And then the other thing was just this... I think one of the\nreasons it was so captivating was also the idea of if I did\nnothing, the world still existed. Or I could act in quite a passive way. I\ncould just listen to the radio, I could... Look at billboards, I could talk to\npedestrians, and not in GTA III, but by Vice City, you could begin\nrudimentary talking. And the world was there and existing, and so it was\nthe idea of almost something that really tried to explore in lots of games,\nthe idea of being a digital tourist. You know, you\nwere in, you were in these worlds, and you went there\nas a visitor, and they existed almost independent of you. It felt like\nwhen you turned up, the world was running. It didn't feel like you'd started it. Of\ncourse, you had started it, but that feeling, I think, was one of the things, the illusions\nthat people found very captivating, was, \"I'm in a world that both\ndoesn't exist and does exist.\" - So there are these two concepts that I\nwas reading about, just to put names on them: one is systemic video\ngame design, so systemic games, and the other is\nsandbox video games. And the systemic is from the environment\nperspective, which means that there are these interlocking game rules and systems that\ninteract with each other and produce emergent behavior. And that emergent behavior is what creates\na feeling like there's a living world. And then the sandbox aspect, which is\noverlapping but different, is from the user perspective, from the\nplayer perspective, the feeling like you can do anything. And when\nthose two things combine, the feeling like you can do anything, and\nthe feeling like there's a world that's full, that is\nalso doing anything it wants, that creates this incredible\nfeeling of, like, \"This world is alive. - And I'm in it.\" - And I'm in it. - And it's the combination of those two\nthings, I think, that is very powerful. And I think with GTA III, you know, for me, it came at a\nreally interesting time in my life personally, and I was very able to engage in\nit, probably for the first time professionally, actually away to do something.\nAnd we were really sort of scratching, began to scratch the surface\non how do we fill these worlds with content, and how do we make that content\ninteresting and make the content all interwoven? So, as you start to\nmess with these systems, they also feel alive and interesting. - There's often been a tension\nthrough your work between an open world, that freedom,\nand the narrative... ...driven storytelling. And I think you've\noften, maybe always, gotten the balance right. So what is the value of each,\nand how do you get the balance right? - Well, I think the open world is intrinsically\npretty fun. It's just fun to be in a world and have complete freedom. And\ncertainly, I think at various points, we debated or, you know,\nI'd have theoretical discussions in my own head with myself, or\nother people in the team would really push for less story, less story.\nYou know, let the whole thing evolve organically. You know, have it\nall be procedural. Have it all just evolve from what you do. I think\nfor me, I would always come back to going, \"Story can be,\nif done well, can be incredibly compelling, and it gives you\nsome structure.\" So, I think... and something to do, and it\nhelps you from a game design perspective unlock the features.\nIt means we know the features, the big features 'cause they, you know,\nessentially when you put someone in a world and give them a whole new way of\ninteracting with that world through the control panel, it can be a little overwhelming.\nYou know, playing a game is a lot more of an engaging experience even than reading\na movie, you know, reading a book or watching a movie. You've got to engage\nin it properly. So how you unlock the features and how you unlock the\nworld, there's an art and a skill to that. And I think we felt that\na structured story was the best way to do that and to have control\nover that process. And also just, you know, people are looking in their lives for\nstory. I think story's very important and very powerful, and when you combine the\ntwo successfully, you get the best of both worlds. But it is a... You know, there\nis a tension always there. I think in a game like GTA IV, which I worked\non and loved and I thought the story was great, but we got criticized because\npeople felt there was almost too much story, and that meant you cared too\nmuch about Niko, and he wasn't as effective an avatar in the\nopen world. I think we probably got closest to reconciling them as perfectly as they can be\ndone in Red Dead II, or when playing as Trevor in GTA V if you wanted to be crazy. I think those\nwere when it really worked, the character, absolute freedom, 'cause\nalso you didn't want... In any game, you don't really want to compel the\nplayer. If you're giving them freedom, you don't want to say, \"Well, I'm giving you freedom, but then I'm taking\nit away 'cause you've got to be this kind of person when you're free.\" So I liked it when it could be... He\ncould, you know, he or she could veer to be nice, veer to be nasty. I think that's\nwhen it was at the strongest. So you kind of want a character that was rounded and\nyou felt had good sides and bad sides. - But you felt that character's personality. - Yes. - You felt the depth. You've actually talked\nabout this... the really powerful concept of creating a 360-degree\ncharacter. I think somewhere you mentioned that in order to do\nthat, you had to be able to imagine what that character would do\nin any possible situation. ... which is a really interesting philosophical concept. I started to\nimmediately think of that, can I imagine... How good of an NPC am I? Can I\nimagine myself in every possible I tried to do that very much when I, when I look at human history,\nwhen I look at the Roman Empire, when I look at World War II within the\nGerman side, the Russian side, the British side, the American side, just I\nimagine myself if I was a soldier. - But that exercise, like\nif you put Trevor as a soldier in World War II, what would he do? - No, I mean, that may be going a little bit too\nfar. But basically, what are the limits of the integrity? What are the limits? of how romantic is he? How narcissistic?\nAll those kinds of elements you have to think about in order to\ncreate the full character. What does it take to create that kind\nof 360 character? How hard is it? - It was a lot of thinking. Sometimes a\nyear from when we begin talking about a project and dialing it. I would just get some initial ideas,\nlike one sentence. They are a Serbian immigrant, or they are\na retired gunfighter with a wife in, you know, type. Very simple\nstuff. And then just start to think through it from every angle. And you know, start to think,\n\"Would it work if they acted like this? Would it work if you acted\nlike that? If this is the world, how does it contrast with the world?\"\nBecause I always thought the games were a kind of mathematical equation.\nThey were the personality of the world, you know, multiplied or\ndivided by the personality of the protagonist. And when that creates\ninteresting friction, that's a really fun experience for the\nplayer. It's almost always at least one or more of the\nprotagonists, cause obviously in GTA5 we had more than\none. We'd have someone who'd moved to the place or was in a new part\nof the place, or moved to a new part of the map, cause it was really, as a player, I think\nit was really easy, much more easy, to identify with your avatar when they,\nlike you, were a fish out of water. And even when they weren't, we\nstill made them dissatisfied and feel like a fish out of water themselves. So I\nthink it was just living with those characters and getting ideas and going,\n\"What are their strengths? What are their weaknesses? How are they like me? How are\nthey not like me?\" You know, and then and slowly, what is it like\nto feel like a human being? You know, and then in most of\nthese games, how much of a psychopath are they? How much of a\nsociopath are they? And what are their good qualities? What is going to give them\nhumanity alongside that? What are they, what are they, what for\nthem apart from money is worth dying for? And then you start to\nbuild it out from these fundamental sides. And suddenly you go, \"Okay, actually I can\nstart to feel...\" And then how do they speak? You know, because fundamentally it doesn't really matter what's\ngoing on in their head. They haven't actually got one, but what they say is what's going to\nmake you realize who they are. - So develop more depth and\ncomplexity on the good and evil side of that human that is a part of all of all human beings. So you're basically\nliving with that character. Then if we can contrast what is it, Nico and Trevor with, for example, another character I'm sure you've\nbeen living with for a while, which is the AI system, Nigel Dave, you've\nbeen working on recently. As part of A Better Paradise World,\nwhich is more dystopian, dark, tragic, still funny, philosophically deep. - I hope so. - But the AI system in there, the super\nintelligent AI system, is named Nigel Dave. And it has, I mean, at least from\nmy current experience with it, it has a conflicting nature. Maybe it's psychopathic; I haven't\nquite figured that out yet. - I don't think he's decided. - Yeah, I don't think he's decided\neither, but he seems to be bent on world domination, although he\ndoesn't take credit for it. He wants to fix humanity and it seems that the \"children,\" quote\nunquote, that it creates are the real monsters. And actually, there's a\nreally interesting idea there which is maybe it's not the AGI, ASI we should\nbe afraid of, but the children it creates. Because the AGI has this human-like\ngood and evil in it; it's conflicted, it's chaotic, it wants to be\nhuman, it wants to be loved, maybe it wants to love. But the children,\nthe monsters it creates, are the ones that are doing the world\ndomination, the maximizing paper clips. Anyway, that's a character and you have to\nbuild that up, you have to think through that. So you've been living with\nthat one for a while? - Yeah, I've been living with him for\nthe last few years, on and off. I felt with a lot of portrayals of AI, they tended to be one note, and AI\nwas sort of infinitely clever, but didn't really have much purpose apart from to\nkill everybody and was just this kind of sort of Borg-like fog. And I thought, \"That's fine, but maybe we can\ndo something, you know, more interesting.\" AI is being built by humans,\nand humans, you know, and built by computer engineers, and there's\na lot of power struggles in any computer engineering team. So I just wanted\nto explore the idea of it was built by two lead engineers who didn't like each other. So, Nigel Dave, who's renamed himself,\nthey wanted to call him something sort of Primal Adam, and he renamed himself Nigel\nDave 'cause one dad was called Nigel, and one dad was called Dave. And he's\njust riddled with these conflicts and riddled with his, it's\ngonna become clear in the next, or clearer in the next\nvolume of the book and and in the game, he's riddled with\nhis dad's previous careers. But he is, I, with the idea of he's almost infinitely intelligent or can\nlearn almost everything, but has zero wisdom. And so the only thing he knows,\nand then he's seeing the world through the internet. The most he can do to be\nin the human world is hack into someone's phone and watch them, but he's stuck,\npressed against. He can't actually get into our world. So he's, he can control\npeople's minds arguably, but he can't control the world. And so he wants\nto be human, he wants to have these human experiences. He sees all this stuff on,\nyou know, the internet, goes, \"Oh, I want to get married. I want to fall in love. I\nwant to...\" 'Cause that seems fun. \"I want to have...\" You know, he's a digital\ncreation, so he wants to have metaphysical experiences, and he's trying to imagine\nwhat that will be like. \"Oh, that's what children are.\" You know, \"That's what love\nis.\" And he's... So I think he's So I think he might be a sociopath,\nand he certainly has sociopathic tendencies. But then\nhe kind of thinks that if he can imagine good and try to do\ngood, that will make him a good AI. So I think there's something\nsympathetic about him. And I kind of like him as a character, but I\ndon't think he's going to be the protagonist. He's more of a side character. - But an ever-present one. - Yes, or nearly ever-present. Occasionally,\nhe sulks and goes off and hides somewhere and stops paying attention. - Yeah, but there are some characters\nthat really create a flavor of a world. - In his world, he was built\nas an AI agent for this digital, large-scale, massively\nmultiplayer video game these people were trying to build. And so\nhe's almost like God in his world. He's not quite God, but he's got a lot of the\nqualities of God. So he has to deal with, \"Am I God? Am I human? Do I exist?\" - And of course, there's the leader\nof the, the CEO of the company, that's also a character. That's probably an amalgamation\nof many of the leaders of the different AI companies today.\nHis name is Mark Tyburn. And Kurt, one of the employees... of the company talks about Tyburn\nas, \"He hated humanity more than he loved it. Perhaps all\nthe most extreme fantasists are like that. All those people who\nwant to build their own utopia. They love the idea of heaven\nmore than the reality of Earth.\" Do you think that's always going to be the\ncase for the most part, that power and money is going to corrupt\nthe people that create ASI? - Yes. I mean, I think there are\ntwo processes. I think there's the power and money corrupted him in\nthe end, as well, but I also think that there's something fundamentally\nanti-human about people who want to build utopias, or paradises, or heavens.\n'Cause what they're saying is, \"I like humans apart\nfrom the bad bits.\" And I mean, I try to be a\npluralist who likes all kinds of people. And I think there's a side\nwhere people are just hideous perfectionists, want to get\nrid of the rough and the nasty and the ugly and the dirty.\nAnd that's a huge side of us. So I worry about those people.\nI find them, you know, it's a different kind of sociopathic behavior. - \"I like humans apart from the bad\nbits.\" That's so beautifully put. Yeah, that there's... It's so counterintuitive,\nbut the people that say, \"We're almost there, we\njust need to... There's this path we take and\nwe'll be perfect then\" and that somehow gets us into trouble.\nIt's so fascinating that we have to like the bad bits, we have to love\nthe bad bits about humans. Those bugs are features. - Yeah, and there's bad bits\nand there's flaws. And I think we're all flawed, and we can\nreally try to be better people. But we still have to accept that we're flawed and we're not\nperfect, and we have to accept that in other people. And I think when we do that,\nwe're more human, and that's probably usually the right course. - I mean, it really is a return to that Solzhenitsyn line of, \"The line between good\nand evil runs through the heart of every man.\" And he also, like, the full description\nof that is really powerful, which is the line moves from day to day, from month to month throughout the life of the\nperson as they understand better and better. And as the perspectives shift,\nas you evolve, as the world around you evolves, as you gain\ndeeper and deeper understanding. And as the flaws in this\ncombinatorial way affect your own understanding of your own flaws\nand self-reflection. So yeah, it's a beautiful mess, and\nall of us have that line. - Yes, and I think when you forget\nabout that line, then you get in real trouble. When you forget there's\ngood and evil in you, in others, in the world, that there is both good and\nevil, and there's certainly good. And that all we can try to do is be better. - And it's funny, that Naiyo Dave,\nby the way, I like the name. It grew on me very quickly. Has\nthat line and is struggling with it. And it's fascinating to\nwatch. It's really, as a character and there's also going to be a video game\nof A Bitter Paradise, potentially? - Yes. - Okay. - Yeah, we've got that in early\ndevelopment in Santa Monica. - Oh, nice. - And it's pretty fun.\nIt's very early, but we assembled a really fun team,\nand they're doing amazing work. So it's a pleasure\nto work with them. - I mean, it would be so great and\nI suppose new for you because it's kind of near-term future. - Yes. First, I always... Well, I\nalways wanted to do something in the sci-fi-ish space.\nBut only if I could do it... I was like, \"Well, what is sci-fi?\"\nIt's science fiction, right? Science is a theory plus fiction. And so I've always thought the best sci-fi\nfor me was when it wasn't just kind of space opera, but there was a\nreal obvious sort of hypothesis. The story was Blade Runner,\nis my favorite, and that's obvious, you know, the replicants are\nbetter than the humans. And so this, I finally felt we\nfound an interesting hypothesis. The AI is more intelligent than\nus, but he's also as broken as we are. That was an interesting\nhypothesis to explore. You know, what happens when AI runs rampant\nin its own fake digital world? That was the... I felt\nthat we had a hypothesis that was worth exploring, and could give\nus some really interesting visuals and give us a really\ninteresting story to tell. - And it would be incredible to\ncreate a sort of AI video game as the world is developing smarter\nand smarter AIs. It allows us as humans to play the game and\nto reflect on the thing that we humans are creating. It's a real\ncommentary as the thing is happening. So I have to ask, as a\nperson who loves literature, and one of the, if not the greatest\nwriter in video game history. Kurt, in the book- of Better Paradise,\nhas this nice line that I think is thoughtful: \"At one point in\ncollege, I even wanted to be a writer. How ridiculous is\nthat? A writer. Language models ended that fantasy for me\nand millions of others. So instead, I decided to get a master's in\nmarketing and started to sell language models.\" So you, as a writer and creator\nof some of the most legendary narratives, - Thank you - in recent history, how\ndo you feel about LLMs being able to write in a way\nthat looks awfully human? - I'm not that afraid of\nthem for large-scale concepts. I don't think they're going\nto be very good at that. I think if you were... I think it's harder if... I\nbegan and I was too shy to tell anyone I wanted to be a writer.\nThat's why I ended up in video games. And I would scribble away,\nlike writing manuals and writing on like PS1 games, all 12 lines of\ndialogue in a game. Sometimes I wouldn't even get that job and I'd just\nwrite the website copy. And then by working your little\nbits and pieces. And then, you know, I'd luckily done enough work\nthat when GTA III turned up, it was the first thing that resembled real\nwriting. I had all of the small bits of skills that I could assemble into\nit. Based on my fairly limited understanding of how language models\nwork, they're not going to replace good ideas. They can't really come up\nwith good new ideas. What they can do is do low-level stuff. So I think it's\ngoing to be harder for people to start out in some of these spaces. If you're not a very\ngood concept artist, you're in a lot of trouble. If you have original ideas,\nI think you're fine. But I think, I also think that they've done\nthe first 90% of the work to sound human, 95% possibly\nin some areas. The last 5% is going to end up being\nabout 95% of the work. I think that last bit with\ntech, in my experience with things like facial animation, it's always\nbeen the last bits and pieces that take far longer than the first bit. And so I'm\nprobably a hideous Luddite, but I'm less scared than a lot of people. I think you're going\nto end up with a lot of work that looks the same. It's going to help people be creative in some\nways. It's going to get some people who probably shouldn't be in that space out of that space.\nBut if you've got talent, I think it'll be fine. - Yeah, I agree with you totally,\nactually. And it's hard to really put a finger on it. So, one\nway to illustrate that, I speak English and Russian,\nand I'm reading Dostoevsky in both languages and using LLMs to translate\nback and forth because I was preparing to have a conversation with\nthe translators of Dostoevsky. - Which ones? - Uh, Richard Pevear and Larisa Volokhonsky. - Yeah. I read it when they first did\nCrime and Punishment. That was amazing. - They're wonderful translators, and\na wonderful love story too. But in the translation process, you\nget to see the LLM is missing some magic. And that couple of\ntranslators are world-class experts at capturing the magic. And I can't quite\nput that into words. Because you said, like, totally novel ideas, yes. But also this magic of the timing, the\nright word at the right time, - Yeah. The phrasing. - captures the human experience. So\nthey can do some really incredibly human-like, the 90%, like you mentioned,\nhuman-like phrasing about the bulk of the storytelling. But the magic,\nyou know, whether it's the endings of Red Dead Redemption\none and two, the timing of that, the word choice of that,\neverything around that. But it's hard to argue because they're incredibly\nimpressive, winning all kinds of math competitions. But what is\nthat magic? And again, that could be just a romantic human\nside of me saying that LLMs won't be able to capture that, maybe\ndesperately holding on for hope. - I don't think they're going to come up with magic. I\nthink they're going to be fantastic at coming up with really cheap, decent stuff. - I have to ask you about your writing\nprocess. We can break it up. On Grand Theft Auto- GTA IV is when it\nreally started ramping up. How much writing went into the Grand Theft\nAuto series? How many words are we talking about? I saw thousands of pages. - I mean, when we printed out the scripts\nfor GTA IV, it was about this high. And GTA V, it was about that high. But that was\nincluding all the pedestrians who had pages and pages just to create the\nillusion of a living world. Because you interact with\neach one of them. But even the main script for the main mission\nwas thousands of pages long. - What was the writing process like on\nthat, to generate one page at a time? - Bit by bit, by bit, over several\nyears. But you start with once people are determined, \"Oh,\nhere's the, here's the world. We're doing one based on a version of\nNew York,\" so GTA IV. And, um, I was living in New York, had been\nliving in New York for a few years. Wasn't sure if I was happy. I was\ngoing through a lot of personal dramas, as usual. And that was why I was looking at some of GTA IV\nagain recently, and it's really dark. And I was like, \"Ah,\nthat's why.\" You know, I was a single and miserable, and I wasn't sure\nI wanted to stay in America. My life was in a lot of flux. As a company, we'd\nhad all that Hot Coffee drama, so constantly thought we might be shut down in\nthe middle of making that. You know, a lot of drama in the company, so it felt\nlike, having had this run of success and, and relative\npersonal stability from GTA III, Vice City, San\nAndreas, suddenly 2005, '6, '7, early '7, life felt very unsure. Um, and that kind of bled into it.\nBut in terms of the process, it was... trying to find an underbelly to New York and\ncapture an immigrant experience that I'm not entirely sure how accurate\nthat immigrant experience was in 2008 when the game came out. And then tell it,\nsorry, from a different angle as an immigrant, which I thought made it, made it interesting.\nAnd then this sort of journey around these various New York characters. So\nI kind of spent probably a year traveling around with cops or meeting people\non and off, and, you know, wandering around New York and driving around, and, you know, on\nand off. While, just go out for the morning from the office, normal\nstuff. But doing that through 2005, assembling little notes.\n\"Here's a funny character for this, here's how...\" Figuring out the order\nwe want to travel around the map in. Characters of this, what was\nan interesting take on, on, on the, you know, mob for that kind of time\nperiod. What was an interesting take on some Jamaican hoodlums for\nthat kind of time period. And assembling lots of notes and\nmore and more notes, and really, really, really running away from the work.\nWhich is, you know, I have to admit, it's part of my process, if there is any kind\nof process, which is not doing work. Thinking about it, but not working. You\nknow, a lot of time... And then, and then it all kind of... Pages and pages of notes,\nmake more notes, no actual work. Months and months of this. And then finally\nset myself a deadline, told all the other people, on the senior people on the\nteam, \"Okay, I have a story draft due Monday morning.\" I can't even remember\nwhat I'll say, February the 1st. And then the, the weekend before was in\na cabin we had upstate, and just stayed up all night, knocking\nthese notes into shape. Assemble about probably a 30-page document,\nso story synopsis and a character synopsis for each of the major characters.\nAnd then hand that over, and that gets broken, that would get broken down with\nme, with me and the designers. And I was always clear, \"I'm not a game designer,\nI'm a sort of creative director.\" We need to break that down into missions. And then that takes another year or\nso of that slowly assembling. And then begin... But then it's a...\nBut the bulk of my work's then done for a bit, so I can relax and, and offer\nopinions on other people's work and feel... be lazy for a bit. And then start to worry, 'cause then I've actually\nsoon got to start writing dialogue. And for GTA IV in particular, it's like, \"We're going\nto try and write...\" You know, our animation's going to Our animation is going to be a lot better. Our\ncharacter models are going to start to look better. The world is going to look amazing.\nTherefore, we can support longer scenes. We can have more in-depth characters. But we\nhave to find a tone that works with the game. It's not easy, no problem. Then I\nstart to worry and worry and worry. And also, writing as a Serbian\nimmigrant. I was an immigrant, but I'm not Serbian. And trying to capture\nwhat on Earth that would feel like. Just start to worry, you start to worry\nagain. Avoid work for as long as possible. And then just sit down and start hammering\naway at a keyboard again late at night. Hammering away at a keyboard and\ngoing, \"Does that right? Is that...?\" Once I get one speech, one turn of phrase that I would like for a character,\nthen they suddenly come alive in my head. So it was like writing\nwith Niko, and he's this kind of awkward, he's out of town, but he's got more self-assurance in some way\nthan the American characters. Once I kind of talked him through it like this, he\njust stepped slightly back from their ridiculousness. And he's that... Then he started\nto come to life. Then I would juxtapose him and his cousin who\nhad this much more Americanized energy, and that felt like it was a\ngood double act. And then from there it starts to come to life.\nBut it's written in small chunks for the motion cap... So\nthen we'd motion capture small chunks. And then the other writers\nwrite the mission dialogue for small chunks. And we'd slowly\nassemble the game, 10, 15 missions at a time, over\nthe next year and a half. - Do you remember a few lines\nthat brought Niko to life? - Yeah, I think so. It was a couple of... his incredulity when his cousin picks him\nup in an old car, and he's not living this fancy American lifestyle. And his cousin's...\nIt was so... which was a kind of comic moment. His cousin's... And then they\ngo to the cousin's flat. And the cousin also, even though he was a sort\nof failure, was still upbeat. And then when he talked to the cousin and\nhe talked about his wartime experiences, and how harrowing they were. I was\nlike, \"Yeah, can I make this work in a game?\" It's very different from stuff you\nnormally see in games. Is it going to feel ridiculous? And I remember being very\nscared because I thought it might be too much. It might feel over\nthe top. I think, you know, the game's so pretty. The artists\nare doing such an amazing job. The game's looking... I think we can get\naway with this. Let's try it. And then they motion capture the animation. Then after\nthat, it's like, \"Yeah, it kind of works.\" I think that moment... those were both pretty\nearly. Once we had those, we went, \"Okay, we've now got comedy and tragedy with this character.\nNow it's working.\" You remember, \"During the war, we did some bad\nthings, and bad things happened to us.\" \"War is where the young and stupid\nare tricked by the old and bitter into killing each other. I was\nvery young and very angry.\" \"Maybe that is no excuse.\" - Yeah, he escaped. He's a veteran.\nHe escaped the trauma of war to come to America to pursue\nthe American dream, I suppose, which became for him this thing\nthat drags him back into violence. - Yes, he can never escape\nhis sort of violent past or... I don't know if he can never\nescape it. He never does escape it. You know, whether he's got agency\nor not is a whole another question. Of course he doesn't, because\nhe's a character in a video game. But, you know, whether he ever could\nhave escaped it another way, who knows? - I think he's probably the greatest\ncharacter for me created in the Grand Theft Auto series. Of all the\ncharacters you've written in Grand Theft Auto, would Niko be the\nbest character you created? - I think he's the most innovative. And the most morally defensible\nin some ways. You know, he does a lot of stuff where\nhe's fighting for what's right. He's the nicest person in some ways.\nIs he the best protagonist of a GTA game? I think he's the most\ninnovative protagonist of a GTA game. Structurally, he might be\ntoo nice in some ways. He's also tough, like he just comes\nacross as tough. I loved CJ in San Andreas. I thought Melee did\nsuch... Just the way he spoke gave him such humanity. So I just loved...\nIt wasn't the writing, it was the quality of the voice acting,\nit was just so strong for him. I think aspects of Michael, he was\nso understated, but he loved the character, but he brought so\nmuch humanity to this character who's so flawed, who is such a...\nyou know, he has no principles. He sells everyone out. I think Ned\nLuke did such an amazing job and didn't necessarily get as many plaudits\nas Steven Ogg for Trevor, who was also wonderful. But I think the Ned\nLuke character sort of anchors that game so much. So I like all of them\nin different ways, but I probably love Niko the most. - And of course, Michael's\nfrom Grand Theft Auto V. And he's one of three protagonists\nwith also Franklin and Trevor. And you said that of the things\nyou're proud of creating and you think was a great accomplishment,\nit was Red Dead Redemption 2, the ending of Red Dead Redemption 1, all of Grand Theft Auto IV, and the\nmiddle part of Grand Theft Auto V when the three characters come together.\nCan you speak to the Grand Theft Auto V? Is there some degree... I don't know\nif you're a Dostoevsky guy, but... - A little bit. - Is there some aspect of the three protagonists, sort of,\nyou know, Brothers Karamazov, ...Alyosha, Dmitry, and Ivan, sort\nof, using the protagonists to explore the spectrum\nof human nature and... - Yes, sure. - ...just the tension between\nthem that allows you the, the, the three of them become a\ncharacter in themselves. - Their relationship. - Their relationship. - is more... Yeah, it was, it was,\nI think one of the reasons that, that the team did such... That Grand\nTheft Auto is still so popular is we always tried as a group to really\ninnovate from game to game within the confines of what it was. It was a crime,\nit was a crime drama, you know, began as a crime, a crime sim in\nGTA 1 about stealing, you know, 2D top-down cars. And we always\ntried to innovate with the narrative and innovate with the art direction,\ninnovate with every piece of the game. And I think having done,\nyou know, GTA IV, which was this kind of operatic journey for\nthis big lead character, and then these two extra stories that came\nafterwards. So the challenge, the, the, the challenge was, can\nwe combine... Can we make a video game which tends to be very much\nfocused on one protagonist, but have multi-protagonists? And the technical challenge of moving from\ncharacter to character. The team did such an amazing job that I don't\nthink people realized how hard it was. But we would sit there just sort of holding\nour heads 'cause they hurt so much around like, what happens if you do this, then\ndo that? It's just, this is so hard. Why have we, why have we decided to do\nthis? It's horrible. And then it all came together. But I think\nthe idea was to develop three characters who do feel like\ncharacters. They don't just feel like philosophical, you know,\npsychological avatars. But where one is really, really driven by\nego, one is really driven by id, and one is really driven by\ntrying to get ahead. So some kind of representation of the super-ego and see\nhow that feels when they all play off against each other. - One of the most upvoted\nquestions on Reddit about GTA V, From a fan, \"GTA V is my favorite\ngame ever made. I spent over 1,000 hours in the world of\nGTA V and GTA Online. GTA IV is a hard second or third. It\nnever ceases to impress me. When you lead a team of over 1,000 people\nto make a masterpiece like GTA V or Red Dead Redemption 2, how do you ensure\nthat the bar of perfection is always met? How's that even possible? We know\nthe answer isn't money, because there's other studios with a lot of money,\nand they are two decades behind Rockstar.\" So what does it take to\ncreate these worlds, to create these incredibly compelling games and stories? - I think the cult- I mean, certainly\nwhen I was at Rockstar, I was a worker amongst workers. You know, the\nculture was one of excellence and tried to provide creative clarity.\nAnd people would just, you know... And also an ambition\nto make... I think we were like... We thought GTA III\ncould be really popular. Really popular to us meant, quite honestly,\nit's gonna sell two or three million copies. And we thought we were making something\npretty innovative. I mean, we knew we were making something innovative, but we didn't\nknow if people would understand how innovative it was. And then when we got\nthe chance to make Vice City, and to try and repeat it, I think\nevery time from then on the team was very driven to make something\nbetter. And to use, this was long before we had lots of resources, to\nuse time and whatever money we had to always put impressive stuff\non the screen, always think about what we can do to push the medium of video games and the sort of\nmedium of building fake worlds further. And that was always... You know,\nthere was a, it was, you know, both clarity of, \"Here's what we're trying to do.\nHere's what the tone of the game is going to be. Here's how features will fit into\nthat, and why these features would work and these features wouldn't work.\"\nBecause fundamentally by 2002, you could put pretty much any feature into a game\nyou wanted. It wasn't a question, it wasn't a technical limitation. It was\njust making it cohesive. And then it was also just everyone\ncommitting to a culture of excellence. - Navid Khansari, an award-winning\ndirector and virtual reality game maker, who worked with you on a number of Grand\nTheft Auto games, spoke highly about his time working with you. Quote,\n\"We always worked ourselves to the bone, but it wasn't coming from\nthe top down. Sam and Dan always rolled up their sleeves, and they\nwere always there. They never left us holding the bag. We all thought\nwe were making badass shit, so it didn't matter how hard we worked.\"\nSo I'm sure there were some tough grinds. - I think finishing it is certainly...\nIt's tough, but it also is intensely rewarding. And you\nget something done, and you've made something. And that\nfeeling is, as you say, really, really incredible. I mean, it can\nsometimes feel a bit empty as well because it's... when you're finished, you're like, \"Then my\nlife's got nothing to it,\" and then you have to... You know, but that's the same with any big\nundertaking that you take. I don't think there are... You know, when you're working that hard,\nyou do not have a good work/life balance. But the truth is, you're not\nworking that hard all of the time. So you just have to manage\nit slightly differently. - Man, that's such such a heavy thing about the human experience.\nI've talked to Olympic gold medal winners, and many of them face real depression\nafter they win the gold medal. because they've been pursuing a thing that they deeply care about.\nThis has been everything, and they're so truly happy to do it,\nand then it's like, \"What else is there in life?\" What, compared to\nthis, what else is there? So that's the ups and downs of life. You\nneed the darkness and you need the lows to really experience\nthe highs. Let me ask you about the pressure.\nThere's an insane level of excitement and expectation\nfor Grand Theft Auto VI. Same was true for GTA V and\nGTA IV, and even before that. And you and the team delivered\nevery time. How difficult was it to do creative work under such pressure\nwhere everyone expects this to be a success? - I was pretty good at\ncompartmentalizing, you know, and just saying... I try just to go, and with all\ncreative work, I go, \"Well, I feel like a terrible fraud, but I haven't\nbeen found out yet. Just do my best and hopefully I won't be\nfound out this time.\" And just if I can be... If I can\ngo, \"I tried hard with the work. I tried to do it with integrity. I\ntried not to copy someone else. I have probably done all of the above,\" you\nknow, try to bring something new to it. And we, as a group, made\nsomething we are proud of. Then that's enough. You can't...\nIf you don't want to go insane, or if I didn't want to go insane, I\ncouldn't sit there and worry about financial results. If we made something great and\nit didn't sell, that would have to be okay. Because the goal is\nto make something that's... You know, video games are\nexpensive, so it is a sort of commercial form of creativity.\nIt's a commercial art form, you know. So you have to be in your mind, you're spending\nlarge amounts of someone else's money. You have to try and make it back for\nthem. But at the same time, my argument with myself was, \"Well, if we... The way to\nmake it back is try and make something great.\" So both pressures are pointing\nin the same direction. I think GTA IV was very pressured because\nthere had been all this pressure on the company. The company\nnearly imploded several times due to Hot Coffee. It was extremely\ntough. So I think that felt very stressful. GTA III, the\ncompany was basically broke. But I was young and didn't really care. I\nwasn't living in the grown-up world yet. All of them had their own pressure.\nAll of the games had their own pressure. The more I felt I'd gone into it creatively and tried to be more\nambitious, for me personally, I felt more pressure, you know, when it came\nout, that would have been the right choice. Because again, if\nyou're trying to take big swings creatively and you've spent a lot of money,\nthat can be quite stressful. I think with Red Dead 2, we were\nbehind schedule. We were over budget so much I\ndidn't want to think about it. And you're making a game about a\ncowboy dying of TB, and the game's not coming together. Turns out a lot of people\ndoubt you at that moment, you know, it's not that fun. So I think that\nwas a lot of pressure. But, you know, anything, doing\nsomething new, you know, the new stuff, there's not necessarily pressure on\nreleasing a comic book in the same way, because it's not taken as long, but, you know, if you're\nmaking things, there's always pressure that people are going to like it. - Why do you think there was so much excitement\nabout GTA IV, GTA V, and now GTA VI? - Because they don't come out that\nregularly. And I think we did a really good job of constantly innovating\nwithin what the IP was. The games always felt different, you know, people have\nvery strong feelings: \"I like this one. I didn't like that one as much,\" because\nthey are pretty different. So you would... there would be simultaneously where you know what's going\nto happen. It's a Grand Theft Auto, you know, it's going to be a game about being a criminal, but the\nway it's going to be a game is going to change quite a lot. So I think the way the IP kept\nevolving made people really excited to play it. And we were good at marketing\nthem as well. We really tried to market them in a way that felt like an update of classic film marketing,\nwhere you really felt like you're already in the product just because\nyou'd seen the trailers and stuff. - You've mentioned that you haven't written\nfor Grand Theft Auto VI. What's it feel like Grand Theft Auto VI returning\nto Vice City? This is over 20 years later, but the original GTA\nVice City game was set in the '80s. So maybe inspired by\nScarface a little bit? - Scarface, Miami Vice. - Miami Vice. - and our '80s childhoods. You know what I realized quite a while ago,\nunfortunately, was that we made that game and it was set I think in\n'86. And it... We made it in 2002, so 16 years after. And now it's way past 16 years since Vice City came\nout. So the '80s were not that long ago when we made it. - You know, I think Miami is one of\nthe most unique cities in the world. Especially if you're thinking about\nsatirizing American culture, it has this duality of a glossy surface\nand a dark underworld. It has the influencers, the crypto\nbros, the yachts, bikinis, plastic surgery, sports cars, drugs,\ncartel cash, luxury, super rich people, and the desperately poor,\njust the whole of it. Would it be like the perfect city\nto explore the full cast of characters that are possible,\nthat human nature can generate? - I think it's one of them. You know, there's\na reason why GTA kept coming back to Miami, New York, Los\nAngeles. I think they're all very good for exactly\nwhat you laid out. You know, you could move it to any of\nthose and it would work, you know? - So yeah, there's a melting pot... - Melt... - ...aspect in New York also, right? - Yeah, a melting aspect to LA. You know,\nthere's glitz, glamour, underbelly, immigrants, you know, enormous wealth\nin all of them. I think those are what, I think, are really fun for any, not even\njust the GTA, but for anything where you want a kind of slice of life,\nalmost like a sort of psychotic version of a Dickens book. You know, this\nbig slice of life. He did it with London. You know, this psychotic version\nof these, you know, all kinds of characters in a melting pot. Any of\nthese global cities work well for that. - Do you know if that was ever a consideration\nto go elsewhere, to like a London? - We made a little thing in\nLondon 26 years ago, GTA London, for the top-down for the PS1. That was pretty cute and fun. As the first\nmission pack ever for PlayStation 1. I think for a full GTA game, we always\ndecided there was so much Americana inherent in the IP, it would be really\nhard to make it work in London or anywhere else. You know, you needed guns,\nyou needed these larger-than-life characters. It just felt like the game was so much about America, possibly\nfrom an outsider's perspective. But that was so much about what the thing was\nthat it wouldn't really have worked in the same way elsewhere. - So you've created, I don't know how\nmany, over 10 Grand Theft Auto games. - I think so. - I have to ask, is it a little\nbit bittersweet to say, to not be a part, to say\ngoodbye to the Grand Theft Auto world? And having to watch Grand\nTheft Auto VI be released? Or is it more excitement?\nWhat's the feeling? - I think it's a, it's... How would I describe it? Of course,\nit's all, all of the above, you know, it's exactly as you, you know, pleased to be doing other stuff, excited\nfor what we're working on now, super excited of course, letting go of something\nI worked on in one way or another for like 20 odd years. You know, and wrote on them for the last 10 or 11 that came\nout. Wrote all of them, or you know, lead writer on all of them, whatever it\nwas. So of course, letting go of that is, you know, is a big, is a big\nchange. And a lot, and, and, and sad in a way, because each of the games\nwas a kind of standalone story. It's not quite the same as, as I think\nprobably it would be in some ways sadder if someone continued on Red Dead,\nbecause it was a cohesive two-game arc. That might be more sad to hear someone\nworking on that. But again, not, and that, that will probably happen too. I\ndon't own the IP. That was sort of part of the, the deal. It's a privilege to work on\nstuff, but you don't necessarily own it. - When you're done with the game,\ndoes it always feel like a goodbye? Like when you're done with Red\nDead 2, is it like you're saying goodbye to Arthur? The characters\nyou created, you're walking away. - You kind of are saying goodbye to\nArthur in the end of the game. - Yeah. - Even before the end of the game. Um, yeah, I think you've got, you know, I've been\nwith them for seven, eight years, and you have to kind of let it go or you\ncan't go on to the next one. - Yeah. - So, there's always this thing of, of, \"Okay, that's\ndone.\" And sometimes people would ask me questions and I, about older games. And certainly\nwhen I was in the middle of making new ones in the se- I just couldn't really necessarily\neven remember. And I got a pretty good memory normally, because you kind of\nhave to let it go. So, it's not, it's, you're so immersed in it and\nthinking about it. And certainly in that last period, the last few months, you're\nreally, really immersed in every little nuance and every little detail all of the time. And then\nyou're just not thinking about it in the same way. - Yeah. It's funny from\nthe player perspective, it feels like an old friend that I\nmiss, whether it's John or Arthur or Nico, it's a real goodbye. That's the,\nthere's a real sadness to finishing a video game. Like- - I hope so - ...legitimately- not just\nbecause the story is sad or- - Because you've been with them so long. - Yeah. And it's a real goodbye to close it.\nThere's that feeling when you're sort of closed the video game,\nand it's, I mean, it's like saying goodbye to a friend. And it's- - That's when you finish a book you love. - Yeah. - It's the same feeling. - Same feeling. - And I think that was something\nthat we really, in the early... ...days of Rockstar, really aspired\nto have that, where people would... ...have that. It wasn't just the\nmania of clearing a level, but the... ...feeling of saying goodbye to characters.\nYou know, I think that was something we... really ...wanted to achieve in games that we didn't\nknow was even possible. So, to hear people... say that is incredibly rewarding. - Yeah. The end of On The Road by\nKerouac: \"Forlorn rags of growing... ...old.\" I just remember closing that and\nthinking, \"What the fuck am I doing in this big... ...world?\" It's a melancholic feeling, but\nthere's nothing like that feeling, and you've... ...achieved that. It's so rare in video\ngames to be able to achieve that with Red... ...Dead, and for me, it was\nGrand Theft Auto IV with Nico. I have to ask, in the 2018\ninterview, you talked about... ...satirizing American culture, which I\nthink Grand Theft Auto was trying to... ...do. And you've made, I think, a\nreally powerful observation that... ...on the political front, people\nare getting more divided. It's... ...getting more absurd\nand ridiculous and... ...extreme, so becoming harder\nand harder to satirize because... ...of how rapidly it's becoming ridiculous.\nYou're talking about you don't even know if... ...Grand Theft Auto VI, if\nit's possible to satirize, because by the time you release the thing, it's already going to be outdated in terms\nof the satire will become reality... First of all, it'd be nice to get your\nupdated view on that. And second of all, it seems like you've answered your very\nown comment with American Caper, which... ...seems to satirize American culture\njust fine in how much over the... ...top it goes. Anyway, that's\nlots of questions in there. - One of the things we've enjoyed about\ndoing a comic book is that we are, it... still has lead times. But the lead\ntimes are not four or five years. The lead times are, you know, a year\nwhen we're putting... We can... ...make little updates much, much newer. And we're, you know, we're\njust wrapping issue 10 of a... ...12-issue arc for that. So it's... ...not quite... It's not quite as difficult.\nYou still can get the tone of it. Um, but yeah, I think it's, I think it's an\nissue anyone trying to talk about this... ...current era, which began in 2015,\n2016, is going to have of how do you... ...characterize it when things\nmove so quickly and so fast? - So American Caper is, first of all,\nepic comic book. I love it, the art. - Yeah, the art's beautiful. David Lapham is\nthe artist. He did an amazing job. He is a... He is a wonderful, wonderful storyteller. - What made you want to set it in Wyoming? - I hadn't seen a modern story there\nthat I knew about. I'd started... ...to spend a bit more time in the\nRockies and in the West, and I was... ...like... I'd spent a lot of time in,\nlike, the countryside in Upstate... New York, and thought I never really\ncaptured it quite right. And just the... ...idea of these places as they change\ndidn't... It was a way of doing a... ...crime story that didn't feel the\nsame as a GTA. You know, it was not... ...somewhere you would necessarily set a GTA, but\nit felt like it was really interesting and... under-explored. - And there is over-the-top\nstuff. There's... - Yeah, it's definitely\nslightly over the top. - So let me take notes on this. There's a\nspoiler alert, I guess, from the first issue, I believe. There's\na devout suburban Mormon who commits, I\nthink, serial murder with a shovel as a form of religious atonement. - He is not necessarily the... Sharpest\ntool in the box. And his rather cynical boss is using his\nreligion and some mistakes he's made to blackmail him into\nmurdering business associates. - And of course, there's this Shakespearean sort of two\nneighbors situation, and each of them having a duality of who they\nare in terms of good and evil. So there's a Wall Street transplant\nwho wants to be a cowboy. - Yes. - Who loves to manually harvest\nbull semen. Accurate? I mean... - Yes. - These are the notes I've been taking. - Yes. He is a, um... he is a somewhat\nconfused, longevity obsessed... - Right. - rich dude who's run away to Wyoming and\nis living out an assortment of fantasies. - And bull semen is a big\ncomponent of longevity. - Yes. He's very into all the life\nhacking, you know, \"roiding\" roiding HGH and making money. - And, uh... - has lost his mind living on a big ranch. - Of course, on the theme of\nsatire, there is a woman who sleeps in tactical gear\nand is consumed by online conspiracies, like\nespecially pedophiles in DC. - Yes. Based on someone I know, who got completely red-pilled.\nAnd I was fascinated by the fact that this was happening to people. - Yeah, so, you know, satire of American\nculture. Quick pause. Bathroom break? - Sure. - I think GTA V had the biggest\nlaunch in video game history, and GTA VI has the potential to top that. First of all, do you think it\nwill? And more broadly, what was your definition of\nsuccess for a video game? - I would assume it will because it's so anticipated, and anticipation\nis the best driver of early sales, as we saw with GTA IV versus Red Dead Redemption One. You know, GTA IV far\nmore anticipated, sold much better early on. So I would assume it will sell really\nwell. That was never my definition of success, but you certainly wanted\nto make money. You know, you're... you're spending someone's money. So the number one\nsuccess is, \"Are you making that money back plus a dollar?\" At some level, that has to be...\nthat has to be the single most important. thing so you get to do it again. You know,\nyou've got big teams of people. People need to pay the rent. You have to keep the\nlights on in the business, so you have to make a small profit. If you think in that\nway, that keeps you being creative. I think that was like... Trying to forget\nabout that, it's not really an option. Um, but we almost always did that. We didn't quite\nalways do that, but we almost always did that. I think the definition of\nsuccess for me was had we tried to do new things and done\nthem, or achieved some of our goals. That was the thing that I meant... Again, were\npeople responding to these worlds and these characters in a way that I wanted them to? - Is it crazy to you that video\ngames are able to make billions of dollars, when if you look\nat, like, the '80s and '90s, you know, nobody took\nvideo games seriously. And even in the aughts, it... And now they're basically... I mean, it's very possible\nif you look out 10, 20 years from now that video games surpass film\nas a way to consume stories. - I think they've possibly already done that in some ways. And certainly as a\nbusiness proposition, they've already done that. But I think that's not... You\nknow, as a way of telling stories, I think they're better at telling certain\nkinds of stories, and films are better at other kinds of stories. You know, I think,\nI think if you want a long, discursive adventure, a video game is better. If you\nwant a short, tight experience, a film is better. We always felt games were\nthe coming medium. And so spent 20 years saying, \"Games are\nthe future. Games are the future.\" And, you know,\nbeing sneered at, then being laughed at, then having people\nnod their heads, and then it kind of happening. So I would... Well, you\nknow, at the same time, much as you might say something, you don't necessarily\nbelieve it's gonna be true. But it has become true, and I think still\nthat games are only gonna get better, more interesting, more\ncreatively, you know, diverse. - You said that Red Dead Redemption 2, in\nyour opinion, is the best thing you've ever done. I think there's a strong case to be\nmade that it's the greatest game of all time. What are the elements that make\nthat game truly great, do you think? - I think you had an incredibly strong\nteam working together that was very experienced that had basically been\nin place since somewhere between 2001 and 2006. So it was a long, experienced\nteam. I think we got to spend a smaller group of us\nworking on it from day one, coming up with some wacky ideas that we got to embed in the game. And then\nwe kind had to follow through with. But I think it was helpful that\nwe got to be very creative before it had a full team on it. I think that\nthe cowboy setting is great because it gives a sort of mythic seriousness\nthat sometimes doing stuff in a contemporary setting doesn't allow. You know,\nI think the closest we got to that kind of seriousness was GTA IV, but it just can't... Once\nyou're setting things in the modern world, they're too frenetic. You can't get some of that\nslightly, you know, operatic feel that I love. That some people think is maybe a\nlittle over the top, but I, you know, I love this kind of, you know,\npeople searching for meaning— ...within, amongst the violence. I think\nthat the West and all of the themes around the West really lend themselves to\nthat. So I think that, and then the gunplay was fantastic, and the horses were\nincredible. So I think you had this combination of technical know-how, a very,\nvery strong team, and really strong material. very, very strong team, and\nreally strong material. - Where did you have to go in your\nmind, maybe philosophically, maybe spiritually, to be able to create\nthe RDR world? Of course, it was based on Red Dead Revolver, but that's— - Yes - —that's a fundamentally\ndifferent. I mean, that leap into the great mythic story that\nwas Red Dead Redemption one. And then even more so, Red Dead\nRedemption two. That was unlike anything you, or maybe anyone, has\never created in video games. - Thank you. - So, like, what drugs were involved? - No drugs. - Okay. - No. Stopped the drugs long before. - Okay. - That's why I did all that work. Had nothing\nelse to do. So yeah, open world video games were very good for my mental\nhealth in that way. Kept me busy. But Red, so Red— Dead, I'll tell, I'll give you my version.\nNow the games are made by big teams. So, but I will give you my human\ninterest version of the story from my perspective only. We\nmade Red Dead Revolver, decided that, or finished Red Dead Revolver\nthat had been a Capcom game. And they didn't want to finish it, so we finished it. And they\nreleased it in Japan and we released it in the US in, I think, 2004. And decided\nwe would start work on an open-world cowboy game for PS3. Didn't think too much more about it, and that was\nwhen we did a bunch of other stuff to work on. And slowly, 2005, 2006, the game\nstarted to come to life. I began to meet with the lead designer, Christian\nCantamessa, and thrash out a few ideas and story ideas for the game, and\nbegan to think about some stuff. And start thinking about, well, what works for an\nopen-world game? What works for a cowboy game? And again, I was being\nlazy or procrastinating. - Can we just on a small tangent,\nwhen you mentioned you take notes when you're being lazy. What do those\nnotes look like? Are they like doodles? - They look like either a yellow pad— —or a BlackBerry in those\ndays, or an iPhone in these days. I'll write the subject matter\nand then just email myself a note. Here's a good idea. Here's a good idea. Or\nit might almost be scribbling on a pad. And then I'll assemble, if they're\ndone digitally, then I'll do, I'll assemble them into one long Word\nfile. And then I'll look at them and go, you know, \"Here's an idea,\nhere's an idea, here's an idea.\" See if it comes to anything. See if I now aggregate\nthem together and then read through them. If there's anything coherent there. You know,\nsomething about a character like this, or that. This would be a funny line. This is a line for\nthe main character. Actually make the main character work like this. You know,\nwhat about this relationship? As you start to just play around\nwith, \"What about if we start in that place, go to that place?\" Start just to play\naround with all of the different bits and pieces. And we began to flesh out some flow for the start of the game.\nAnd this idea you'd start in dusty American West, which meant we didn't have\nto make too many trees, and then go to Mexico, and then come back.\nAnd we had a sort of loose flow. And I was really scared of writing\nany actual dialogue. And I didn't have a clue how to go about it. And I kept... It'll come, it'll come. And I\nkept... because I could postpone it for ages because we were doing GTA\nIV. And I kept worrying about it. My work was wrapped on GTA IV,\nbut the game wasn't out yet. And we'd done a bunch of the marketing stuff, and\nhad a little window when I wasn't doing much else. And I took a week with\nmy then girlfriend, now wife, who was heavily pregnant with\nour first child, and we went up to a house upstate and sat\nthere. Well, she, she, she sat there, either cooking for me or\nwatching TV or reading. And I just went and sat in the room all day, every day. And just\nsat there and stared at the computer and tried to think about, \"How can I\ndo this so that it doesn't sound ridiculous?\" How can you write in a cowboy idiom that feels both slightly\ncontemporary but also gives the game this sort of life and this\nweight that I want it to have, and think we can get away with? And after about three days, it just started\nto come. And then suddenly I wrote about nine, 10 scenes in the\nnext couple of days. And after that, I knew I had it. And it was a bit...\nI don't know if that's why there was so much about a character caring about his\nfamily, because I was just beginning the process of having a family. - Oh. - So I don't know if that- I don't know to what extent that bled in there,\nbut I think it bled in there to some extent. - So that was part of creating\nthe 360-degree characters. - I think so. - Here's this man that is capable, is involved in a lot of violence,\nwho also cares about his family. - He's grown up and he's trying to\nstep away from that and be a man, be a grown-up. And can he get away from\nit? And when he can't get away from it, what's he willing to\ndo to save his family? And that was, I felt, starting to\nget some idea. I mean, she, well, She hadn't given birth yet, but I was\nbeginning to grapple with the ideas of, \"I'm gonna become a parent.\" So I hope some\nof that... And obviously, then I didn't, probably didn't write any more for six months. So\nlater on we had a child. But certainly for that first bit, I think some of\nthat began to bleed in there. - ...you got the feeling that you can\nactually do it. It's true, it's... It could have very easily\nbeen ridiculous and not believable, the\ndialogue between convoys. - Yes. - And, yes, I mean, there's\nprobably so much work went into making it feel real and believable.\nAnd, and, like, that... Like a Shakespearean type of\ndrama, but not the cheesy kind. - Well, just wanted it to\nfeel when they spoke. I mean, I, I, I love dialogue. I'm\nalways, you know, I love the sound of words, but just wanted to feel like when\nthey sounded, it didn't sound cheesy, it didn't sound ridiculous. You wanted to\nhear them speak more. It didn't make you cringe awfully when they spoke. That was\nthe... At some level that was all the goal was, and then they felt like this\nguy was gonna go on this life and death odyssey and you cared about him.\nYou had to care about his wife and child that he left behind, even\nthough you didn't know them. - When did you know how you were going\nto end Red Dead Redemption One? - I remember I did a meeting\nwith Christian, the designer. I can't remember\nwhat year. Probably some point late 2008, early 2009, and we\nwere discussing the last bit and, and, and said, \"I think\nhe's gotta die.\" And he leapt on the idea and went, \"That's...\nYes, yes. No, no, wait, no, it can't work. Games can't work like that. It can't work if\nhe's dead.\" You know, began to think through, well, if we... Just technically it doesn't work\nbecause you have to be able to finish all the stuff up, and then began to think through, \"Actually,\nI think we can make it work if we do it this way.\" And so he then really\npushed for that idea, and it seemed to... I was like, \"Ah,\"\nand I was still torn. I thought it was clever narratively but I\nwas torn if it was gonna work technically as a piece of game\ndesign, but I think it did. - Yeah, and spoiler alert, of\ncourse, how do we tell the story of that? Well, so he\ngoes through a lot. He does all the... John does all the dirty work\nof hunting down his old gang and he finally is able to go home\nand be with his family, be on the ranch, and then the\ngovernment betrays him and sends troops to kill him. And there\nis dialogue. I mean, that just, I think the two times I shed a tear in\nvideo game history for me is that dialogue. I think John talking to his wife, if I vaguely remember. I\nthink he said, \"I love you.\" But he said very little. He didn't...\nHe made it seem like he's going to see her and his son shortly. That dialogue was masterfully done, like a definition of like\nless is more. It was just so crisp, that and... And, of course, the other one\nis again, from memory, Arthur riding his horse and the music is playing.\nIt's very hard not to shed a tear during that. Anyway, the\ndialogue of John talking to his wife at the end when he's in a barn\nand is about to walk out. to face certain death. Do\nyou remember writing that? - Oh, yeah. Yeah. But it\njust... Again, I went... The actor was so good and we've already\nseen a bunch of his work by then. He had such a good... He was so good\nat reading those lines that I knew he could give us... that you could\nfeel at that point, like- …I think those lines are best when they're\nreally short and punchy. So I knew— - Got it. - I knew he'd be able to\nmake that line sound good. - So you were imagining his\nvoice. You were just- - And I think all of those\nactors on Red Dead Redemption One were so strong that they\nreally brought that game to life. If them and Rod, the director, hadn't\ndone such a good job, it would have sounded cheesy as hell. - You've said that the ending of RDR1 is one\nof the best things you've been a part of creating. Why is that ending so powerful\nto you? What does it represent? - I think because for the story\nto work, just from a technical challenge, for the story\nto work, he had to die. But for a game to work,\nit felt like a challenge to make him die. It was probably the fourth, fifth, or sixth open-world\ngame I'd worked on, and I'd spent all these years before that\nworking out how these stories worked. How to make them work technically, how to\nmake them feel right, how they interacted with the open-form\ngameplay as best I could. And suddenly we're going to break one\nof our golden rules, which was, at the end of the game, you're freeing the character\nto go and wrap up all the side stories, to play forever. You're not going to be able to do that in this game\nbecause the guy's going to be dead, and we're going to have you play as a different character,\nand the narrative is going to be compelling enough, if we've done a good job,\nwhere you're not going to care about that. Or you're going to be upset that he's\ndead, but you can actually have this emotional moment. So I think it was a big risk from a technical\nperspective for us to do that, and then it worked. So I think that\nwas something that was very… full of fear, and it worked out okay. And I think people were really upset and angry at us for doing\nit because they didn't think it was going to happen, but I think they also had that kind of experience\nyou're describing, which is that kind of creative moment where, you know, a transcendent moment\nwith characters in a piece of fiction, which is what we've always aspired\nto giving people. - I mean, it's incredible because I don't think…\nI don't remember a single video game that has done that before. - Well, I would like to have, at the end of\nGTA IV, killed Niko, but you couldn't do it. You know, the game doesn't work like\nthat. So it was this thing where we hadn't done it, thought about doing it,\nhadn't done it, and then going, \"Let's do it. Let's take the risk and do it. We\ncan't do it. Let's try.\" And it worked. - Yeah, what about the decision\nwith the son? You know, John gives so much effort to make\nsure that Jack doesn't end up in a life of violence. I mean,\nit's very Godfather-like. It's— …he's dragged back into\nit through revenge. - That was also, the game still had to work\nas a game. Whether that was the right ending, 100% the best ending from a pure\nstorytelling perspective, I don't know. But I know that we had\nto make the game work. - Oh, interesting. - So it was... I think it kind of\nworked in that way where Jack can't escape, but I always also wanted\na version of it where Jack did escape, but that wasn't...\nBoth were interesting to me. - Can you just dig in a little deeper? What\ndo you mean about for the game to work? It's such a direct... It's like Kubrick\ntalking about for this movie to work, it has to have... From my perspective, I just\nthink about the story. What's the technical aspect for the game to work? - It's just the mechanical\nexperience is you have an avatar you control, and you know,\nthe games don't really end. You have to be able to wander\naround the world and do stuff. So at the end of the game, you have\nto be able to wander around with your fairly limited set of features, which is you can run up to\nsomeone and punch them or shoot them or rob them, or talk to them. And that's kind of... or jump on a\nhorse or do all this other stuff. In order for the game still to\nbe fun and people to get this full 360-degree experience with\nit, they had to, if they wanted to 100% the game as opposed to just\nfinishing the story, you have to have an avatar to do that stuff with. So that\nwas the sort of challenge of Jack's character, wrapping up the story as Jack. - Oh, there's real power for the\navatar to end, the finiteness. - Yeah. Both the Red Deads, you\nobviously change avatars. Which we did, and then did it again. I think\nthere's something interesting about that moment when you change from one character to\nanother, because they are you and they're not you, you know, and then\nsuddenly you're someone else. - Mm-hmm. I mean, I was\nreally shaken by that experience, but it's a beautiful\nexperience. It's like an unforgettable experience. What else can\nvideo games possibly reach for? You know, to create that experience, that's what great films do, that's\nwhat great, great books do. - It's that. I mean, it's that and the world building\nin games. I think the experience of being in this fake place and then\ntaking on these narrative adventures, when that combines,\nyou've got the amazing experience. - So who do you think is the best\ncharacter you've ever created in RDR? So to me, I think definitively\nArthur from Red Dead Redemption 2 is the best character ever\ncreated in video games ever. - Thank you. - I think there's not even close. I mean,\nJohn will be the se-, which is hilarious to say, but those are... John will be a close second, but Arthur is\ndefinitively. And you've talked about in that interview, you said that\na lot of video games work on the same premise, that\nyou start as a weak person and end up as a strong superhero.\nBut what if you start as a tough guy, someone who already\nis very strong, someone that's emotionally confident of his place in\nthe world? Arthur's journey is not about becoming a superhero because he's\nalmost one at the start, but it's about an intellectual\nrollercoaster when his worldview gets taken apart. So it's very different\nthan the normal journey of a character. - Yeah, in a game... - In a game - ... in order to reverse it. So there were a couple other themes that\nmatched that. So they're guys from the Wild West, but they're being\npushed ever further east. So it's almost like an anti-Western. An Eastern. You're traveling east. You're\ntraveling into civilization. And I don't think I would've been grappling\nwith those ideas earlier in my career, 'cause it was so, you know, this\nidea of getting a different kind of strength and different kind\nof weakness was interesting. - What about the component of mortality, of a\ncharacter facing his own mortality over a prolonged period? Sort of\njust the, the, the, the prospect of like, real sort of fear\nof death, realization of death. - Yeah. I thought that was really- - as part of the story. - really a fun thing to play\nwith. John dies in Red Dead 1, I wanted to top that with\nRed Dead 2, or do that in a different way. And so the idea that\nJohn's death is fairly sudden, and so if he's got this long,\ndrawn-out death, then I'd always been obsessed by TB. As diseases\ngo, it's a great literary device. You know, 'cause it is this long, drawn-out, slow\ndeath, but in which you are also getting weaker. And my grandfather actually\nhad TB before they invented antibiotics and was sent to\na sanatorium just after he was... just after he'd\nhad his child, my father, and survived, but only three of them out\nof like 35 survived. So I was always, captivated by TB as an illness. It felt like it was an interesting\nthing to play around with as an idea, this guy getting weaker\nwho felt like he was immortal and essentially was immortal. He was the\nprotagonist in a video game, he could not die, and suddenly he is becoming\nmortal. You know, but that helps him see stuff. I thought that\nwas a different way of doing a lead character in a game. - Yeah. Do you think it's the greatest\ncharacter you've ever created? - I think he's the best lead character. You know, the lead characters\nare different from the side characters, and I think he's the most rounded\nand works the best. I kind of... Him and Nico are the two I like, you\nknow. They were the two most ambitious. So for me, it's always sort of\na toss-up, you know? But then I loved all the stuff, like\nthe art team did such an amazing job. It was their idea with\nthe journal and that kind of... The way that all the features worked\ninto Arthur's character, I thought that was really... He was really rounded, he\nworked in lots of different ways really well. I loved his flawed\nrelationship with his old girlfriend, things like that. All the side...\nYou know, the bits that turned up around him. - So you also like the side\ncharacters. You like the flavor - Yeah, of course. - of the full cast. What are some\nof the favorites you've created? I'm sure the one you're\ncurrently working on- Nigel, that's a... You\ncalled him a side character. - Well, he's not a protagonist.\nHe's like a god, not a character. So he's not... Him, I'm\nenjoying. I love Dutch. You know, it was partly because\nwe wrote a few lines for him for the first game, and\nthe actor did such a such an amazing job that when\nhe spoke, it just came to me all of their backstory, which I'd been playing\naround with by that point anyway a little bit in my head. But I knew it was his bigger gangster\nfrom then. I sort of saw exactly who he was. And so that was... That felt like...\nHe felt like a living character to me. - And we should say that Dutch is kind of like,\nmaybe a little bit of a godlike figure- in both of the Red Dead Redemption\ngames. He's the leader of the gang. And there's a father-son\nrelationship with Dutch, with, uh, I mean, with Arthur, with John.\nThere's a family feeling to the gang. They explore all of those\ndynamics, and then the feeling of betrayal and Arthur facing tuberculosis. You're going against the family,\ngoing against the father- because he is transforming\nhis sense of the world, of morality, of all those kinds\nof things. So all the kind of very Shakespearean drama is\nright there. And Dutch is a prominent godlike figure\nthrough all of that. Also flawed himself. Also a man\nof good and evil in that, framework that they're operating under. - And he's just drowning\nin his ego at the end. You know, his ego gets the better of\nhim. I think he's a... But there was something flawed but beautiful in his\nidealism when he was younger, and that's mostly off-camera. And then\njust so you know, always been as an individual, I've always been\nvery susceptible to charming people. And he's charming. So I was kind of...\nI can see how people get captivated. by charming people. And the idea\nhere was a very charming person, and the road's run out for him. - I personally am afraid of how\nmuch I love human beings, and how susceptible I am\nto charm and charisma. 'Cause it can cloud your\njudgment about human nature. - Completely. And that's what's\nhappened with him. And it ended up clouding his judgment about himself.\nHe kind of fell for his own rubbish. - Yeah, but also it clouded\nArthur's judgment. - Oh, completely. Arthur was\ncompletely, you know, platonically in love with him. He was worshiping him. He'd\ngiven up his power to him. And then I think for Arthur, the journey is retaking that power in the moment of dying. You know,\nand that's what the whole... that's why I thought that was really interesting. - Yeah, it's truly tragic for Arthur to be losing his identity,\nlifelong identity, and sense of belonging, and\nlosing his life at the same time. In facing mortality, he is realizing\nthat he's not all of it has been a lie. - But he gets to do some... Well, it\ndepends on what choices you make. But he gets to do some good. And so\nhe gets his moment of redemption. - Just a little bit. But realizing... your whole life you've been living not a\ngood life. You've been not a good man. - Isn't that what we're all afraid of? - I guess it's never too\nlate to change your ways. - Hope not. I mean, that's... - So, the biggest, most important,\nprimary question, central to the reason we're talking today, the\nnumber one question from the Internet, it is so ridiculous, but\nI must ask. Have you seen Gavin? Who is Gavin? So, for more context,\nthere's a guy named Nigel in Red Dead Redemption 2 who's frantically\nsearching for a mystery man named Gavin throughout the game. This has become\none of the biggest mysteries amongst the interwebs, the RDR fan\nbase. So, the theories include, theory one is it's a\nsplit personality disorder. Nigel himself is Gavin. So, the evidence for\nthis theory is the letter that has some evidence that may be due\nto trauma, this split personality disorder was created.\nThis Gavin was created inside Nigel's mind. Theory two is Gavin is dead,\nand Nigel's simply in denial. Theory three is that it's just a troll, and Rockstar intentionally\ncreated an unsolvable mystery to drive players crazy. I\nalso heard theory four is Gavin is the Strange Man. So, there's this fascinating character, the Strange Man,\nthis supernatural character that has a presence in RDR1 and a little bit in\nRDR2 also. But yeah. So which theory is closest to the truth? - Not three or four. In my mind, somewhere between one and two. I\njust loved the way he shouted, \"Gavin.\" It just\namused me. So at some level, it probably is trolling in that we didn't\nwant it to be a totally clear mystery. You wanted it to have a little\nbit of adventure to it. but it was meant to be ...\nWithout ever fully being explained that Gavin's not there\nanymore. Gavin's either gone home, Gavin's left him, Gavin's...\nAnd we were going to keep exploring that idea. That he was going\nto reappear in some way or other. - Did you have any idea how much\nimagination, excitement, and curiosity that little interaction\nwould inspire in people? - Yes and no. You could never know what\npeople are going to find amusing in these big games, and a lot of it comes down\nto acting as well. The guy was just funny when he said \"Gavin.\" It was just funny. You know? But there was a ped in Red Dead\nRedemption one that everyone was obsessed by, and I really wasn't expecting\nthat. So we try to put a few characters in. I mean, Gavin was supposed\nto be amusing. I thought he was amusing. But you never know what people are going to\nget obsessed by. There are other characters I think are funny, and people don't even notice\nthem, you know, or they see them in a completely different way. - Did you have a part in writing the letter? - Yeah. I can't remember if I wrote\nit or... Either I wrote it or Mike wrote it, or we both wrote it. I really can't remember, to\nbe honest with you. But yeah, I certainly would have edited it, and Mike might have written it, or I might\nhave written it. I really can't remember. - It's so fascinating because that little piece\nof writing— of course, you have thousands of pages- - Yeah. - ...but that little piece\nof writing gets analyzed. - Oh, but we certainly talked about\nit in depth, and if Mike was here, I'd ask him. He might remember. I can't\nreally... And we do so many of those things. And I loved the use of letters in\nRed Dead to tell all these weird backstories. And some became\nvery clear and some were still a little kind of opaque. But I think\nthe general vibe was there was no Gavin. Either there was no Gavin or\nhe'd long since left. So it's kind of a split personality, you know, and\nthen we were going to over subsequent games provide more information. - So in some sense, you yourself\ndon't quite know. You kind of have an idea, like which way\ndo you lean more, theory one or two? Is he dead, and Nigel's in denial, or is there real\ncommunication going inside his head? - No, Gavin existed. So it wasn't that he was a split personality,\nand the only thing we hadn't really decided was in a future game No, Gavin existed. So it wasn't that he was a split personality,\nand the only thing we hadn't really decided was in a future game were we going to reveal that Gavin was\ndead, or was Gavin going to turn up having long since abandoned this maniac. That\nwas what we were still playing around with. I think the idea was that he was never\ngoing to meet... He was never going to meet Gavin in this game. - I mean, it's just fascinating because\nyou have to think about all of that. You have to write all of that. You have to have\nthose discussions. You have to have those debates. - And it has to feel fresh. Like, what we've done before. Constantly\nlooking as you do. You know, I think I've done, you know, somewhere between\n15 and 20 of these games. Got to do stuff that's new. It can't\nrepeat itself too much. - I mean, we also live in the age\nof the internet. Just, like, you realize there are millions of people\nworrying about where and who Gavin is. - Thank God. - It's like- - It's great, yeah. - It's fascinating that they're having...\nIs, think about people reading, like, James Joyce or something and thinking\nabout the character, like, breaking apart Ulysses and thinking\nabout, like, arguing about different interpretations of it. And to\nme, that in itself is also beautiful. - Yeah. We want the side mysteries to be\nsolvable up to a point, but you still want these discussions. - Yeah, the mystery. - You know, and you want as long as\nit feels tonally appropriate for this whole big sort of shaggy\ndog story experience you're making. Which Gavin was just about,\nand he was so weird, and he just was intrinsically... there was just something\nfunny about an English person screaming, \"Gavin.\" I don't know why. - Yeah. Some of that humor, there's...\nthere's certain in Red Dead Redemption there's humor, but there's\na lot of it in Grand Theft Auto- ...and what... It's\nhard to put into words. why that's funny, why it becomes\na meme, why it becomes viral, 'cause it's just funny. - Yeah, I know why I think it's funny, but you...\nwhat you can't... What I'm not good at doing at least is going, \"This thing will\nbecome really popular online and this other thing won't.\" You can create\nthis bunch of, you know, fifty different side things that people might get captivated\nby, and you just do not know what they're going to respond to. - How do you know when something's\nfunny? Is it... you just feel it? - I know what I think is funny.\nIt's, you know, it makes- - You just Google it or you just- - ...like just 'cause it's\nridiculous as well. That was just... There's nothing funny\nabout a dude shouting, \"Gavin,\" a lot. He just said it in a funny way...\nI just thought it might be funny- It was great... and he just\nsaid it in such a funny way- ...and then it just became funny. Like,\nwe often have those side characters and they're not that funny, and I think they're\ngoing to be hysterical, and then you put them in the game, and they're fine,\nbut they're not amazing. That guy just brought that stuff to life. - Yeah. And his backstory too. I mean,\nLondoner and not... yeah, that... - Yeah, I think that was what... you know, just that\nit... there's something sometimes fun, you know, in... an English person saying the name Gavin\nis quite funny. I don't know why. - So, about the Strange Man, AKA,\nthe Man in Black... Is there some element with Michael and the therapist in\nGrand Theft Auto V? Like, who is the Strange Man? - Well, the Strange Man was\nagain... was, was, was someone we came up with quickly.\nIt... we made Red Dead 1, and we... well, were\nmaking Red Dead 1, and we'd made this... we felt quite\ncompelling story and quite interesting open world. But...\nand we'd already made a bunch of Grand Theft Autos, obviously, but unfortunately,\nwe'd taken out the machine guns 'cause it was a cowboy game, apart from the big fixed\nposition ones. And we'd taken out the cars, and we'd taken out the city and\nlarge numbers of pedestrians. So we essentially had a game about\na dude riding a horse... ...around the desert. And it was\nquite... and it was quite boring. And so we then started filling it with\ncontent, and we filled it with these... and having to improvise. And we filled it with\nthese things we call random events that would be these sort of motion-capture moments\nthat you could interact with. And it... they were, they were... the designers did an\namazing job with those. They were really fun. But there was not enough of them. And then we felt\nwe needed more story 'cause the story was perhaps a little short. So we kind of\nquite late in development started putting in almost like these\nRPG-type content where you go and meet someone. And the way we thought of them was they\nwere like short stories. So you go and meet someone, they'd set you a slow\nproblem, like go and collect me 15 bunches of flowers. And when you came\nback, it would resolve your story. And so then, you know, one would go, \"Go get them for\nmy bride,\" and you come back and the bride's dead. You know, to... We tried to make them like\nthese short stories with a sting in the tail. And he came out... as I was trying to come\nup with ideas for those, as just this weird character. And then we\nbuilt him a bit into the story, where he would unlock as you\nworked your way through and be a commentary on what you were doing.\nSo he was meant to be a kind of manifestation of your, you know, shadow, your karma, the\ndevil, somewhere, you know, just saw the world. And then we built\nout his backstory over time and decided, you know... And so in Red Dead\n2, you could interact with him again and... or not really interact with him. But he was there\nand he was meant to be, you know, something I suppose any creative is scared\nof, an artist who's kind of sold his soul to the devil. And\nthat slowly revealed itself. - There is a connection between\nthe main character and the... Is it like a Jungian\nshadow type of situation? - Well, it's sort of, because he knows\nwhat you're up to. The connection is... what's never really made clear is,\ndoes he know this about everybody? Like, is he following you, or is he\nable, because of the pact he's made with evil forces, able to do this\nfor everybody? I don't think we necessarily ever clarify that. He's\ncertainly able to do it for you. - I mean, there's, sort of narrative-wise,\nthere are techniques to reveal a kind of self-reflection analysis of the main\ncharacter's thoughts. That's why I brought up the therapist with\nMichael. That was a really powerful, interesting thing to do in\na video game. Like, I, I don't think I've seen... That's such a\ncool... I mean, there's a Sopranos element there, with the therapist. - A little bit, yeah. - I really love an opportunity\nfor a character to just self-reflect through that technique. - But it also changed depending\non what you'd done. - Yes. - So it was, it was sort of slightly... It\nwasn't as interactive as it could be, but it was slightly interactive, or\nslightly responsive to what you'd done. So it felt it was still valid video game\ncontent, 'cause it was living, up to a point. And I just thought the character, Dr.\nFriedlander, was just funny, 'cause he was awful. So it was like LA. You're in therapy.\nIt's very LA. But it's also very LA, he wants to write a book and betray you. Which felt like a good, a good twist.\nIt felt like a Grand Theft Auto therapist. But just like the idea\nof making the player in a game, and games are intrinsically kind\nof physical, and, you know, you... you walk, you punch things, you run\naround, you drive cars, you shoot people, whatever. There are these kind of physical\nfantasies. Trying to put them into a slightly more reflective or metaphysical\nstate for a moment, I think can be really fun. - I think, to me, one of the most surprising\nthings about Red Dead Redemption, about video games, that Red Dead\nRedemption showed is how much value for storytelling is insanely\nspecific, intricate details. In the story, but also visually. It just\nadded to the feeling that the world is real. So I have to ask,\nwhat are some of your, um, favorite insanely specific, intricate\ndetails in RDR? I can give you some options. The internet's favorite is horse\ntesticles shrinking in cold weather. testicles shrinking in cold weather. - Yep. Those guys did an\namazing job on those. - I mean, I just... And there must've been a\nmeeting, and there must've been engineers and graphics designers. - It was just, I think just artists. - Artists - Modelers, I think. I don't\nthink it was that hard. - Okay. - Enough of that pun. - Thank you for that. Arthur's hair\nand beard grow in real time. So, gun maintenance matters. Firearms\nget dirty and perform worse over time. Animal carcasses\ndecompose realistically. - They feel like they do. - That's still extremely rare in video\ngames. That, the temporal aspect. - Yes. Yeah. - That permeates through time.\nYou know, NPCs remembering you. - That's the best. I mean, that's the thing I\nlove. Playing around with a lot of stuff in the new games around that, 'cause\nI think it's super interesting. Okay? - It's really powerful, right? - To make them... Yeah, really\ninteresting. I think it just gives a... it's a really fun way of giving\nyou kind of narrative content that is also systemic and procedural. - Yeah. Is it technically really\ndifficult to do for the game, for the game to feel like\nit remembers you? You know? - Um, I think with modern tech it's\nnot that hard, but there's a lot of stuff you need to\ntrack to make it interesting. - Yeah, to have a memory. So that's really powerful. The mud\nphysics. So Arthur's boots get muddy and leave actual tracks. I mean,\nthat's just incredible. Really, really incredible. - You know, we made a dusty game. Red Dead 1\nis a super dusty game. Make, you know, the problem with cowboys is that if you've tried to make\na Greatest Hits of the Cowboy game, and then you've got to make a sequel, you've\ngot to come up with different geography. So that's why the game starts in the snow.\nSo we wanted a game that had snow and mud, because those were things you hadn't really seen in\nRed Dead 1. And then the challenge is how do you make mud good in a game? And the\nguys did an amazing job. - I mean, the snowstorm\nthat starts the game, RDR2, I don't remember the last\ntime I've experienced anything like it, but you felt it. I don't know\nhow the hell you do that. It's not just graphics, it's everything. Everything\ntogether. I suppose some of the dialogue is really important to that. - Also the acting. They feel cold. - Yeah, that's right. - And they feel desperate. There\nwas that feeling of sort of - Yes - exodus. Like you're running away from\nsomething, that gives the game energy at the start. - And it was at night. Oh man,\nit was just masterfully done. - And there was a big group\nof them. The other cont- - Yes. - You know, first game, you start off as a lone\nwolf. Suddenly you're in this big group. So it felt very different. - In Arthur's body, bullet wounds persist.\nSo that, that temporal consistency- ...that's really important.\nUnderweight Arthur looks gone, and overweight Arthur gets a gut. And a fuller face. Again,\nthose decisions that you make reveal themselves in the game across\ntime. And they're consistent. I don't know. I did not see many games\ndo that. It must be difficult to do, but to give that level\nof care to the details in that way across time and for specific graphical representations\nof things is incredible. - Yeah. I mean, I guess- - Do you have favorites where you\nwere first like, \"This is amazing?\" - I think all of it. I think the way the whole...\nTo me, the thing that I would care about most was the way the whole thing sat together.\nYou know, the fact that each of those, they all feel like they\nbelong together with each other. You made this\ncohesive, very, you know, quote-unquote, \"realistic\" for a video\ngame experience, and all the details feel like they mesh. - Well, for me, everything about the horse. For a lot of people.\nTesticle shrinking included. What's the process of deciding?\nThe internet seems to really care about... I mean, they love the game so\nmuch, so they want to know if anything was cut. I'm sure stuff was cut\nbecause you have to choose. What's the process of deciding what to\ncut, what to cut scenes like? Is there any scenes that you had to let go of that\nyou really miss or wish you could've done in either GTA or RDR? - Well, I think the games ended up\nthe way they were supposed to be. You know, I think there was always...\nThere was a bit at the start of RDR where he'd had a baby who just died in Red Dead 2, and\nwe ended up cutting it, which was the right decision. It was too tough in some ways. But I think\nit gave him real... He was not very sympathetic to his occasional\ngirlfriend who'd had the baby. And so, it made him very, very nasty at the start,\nwhich I thought would be interesting to play around with because then it would\nmake his redemptive arc even more interesting. He was not a likable character\nat the start, and that was one... We ended up making him slightly more like...\nHe was still sort of tough and nasty, but he's slightly more likable early on.\nThat was the right decision commercially. It's better that way.\nBut you know, I still like that little bit. It spoke to me\npersonally. And just his inability to access his emotions I thought was really strong\nbecause then later in the game he's getting very emotional. But there are also\nalways little bits and pieces that get trimmed. You know, and don't... Or missions that just are not going to work technically.\nUsually, it's like, \"This mission's not going to work technically. Oh God, we have to\ncut it. Okay, how do we glue the story back together?\" We got\nbetter over time at gluing the story across missing chunks. You get late\nin the game, and it's just something, you know, some big challenging moment just is\ngoing to look rubbish, so you just get rid of it. - I think editing film, and I imagine\nediting video games, editing down is an art form, but it's also\njust... It feels like torture because you're letting go of\nthings you put so much love into. - Yeah, it could be changes. You know, if you fall in love\nwith something and everyone else goes, \"Let's change it,\" that could be... of course that could be upsetting\nin some ways. Otherwise, you can care about it. But, you know, if I was\ninvolved in the big creative thing and you go, \"Okay, it's the right\ndecision,\" I can probably live with that fine. I think sometimes for designers when they're only\ndesigning four or five missions in the whole game and two of them get cut, that\nmust be really... ...Really hard. - Is there DLCs like for RDR or GTA that you wish you had the time when you\nwere there to have created? - Of course. There's always things I wished\nI'd done. I always wished I'd done more. - What would you have added? This\nis a fun, like, nerding out. - We... the internet knows we made\na DLC, single-player DLC for GTA V that never came out.\nAnd we've also never really worked on another game. But I\nlike... the idea of it, it was a GTA zombie game. That would've been funny.\nI think that could've been quite fun. - What was the GTA V DLC? - It was one where you played as\nTrevor, but he was a secret agent. - Oh. - It was... it was cute. It never quite\ncame together, and it was never finished. It was about half done when it got abandoned. But I think\nif that had come out, probably wouldn't have gotten to make Red Dead 2. So, there's\nalways compromises. But it was... you know, I like making the\nstories. For me, I love the model of GTA IV when you had the extra\nstories coming afterwards or Red Dead 1 when you had the zombie pack\ncoming afterwards. I like just doing these extra things. So, I would've\npersonally liked to have done more of that\nin that company. Um, and with stuff we're doing in the\nfuture, we're going to try and come up with worlds where\nwe can add more stories. I like single-player DLC. I just think the\naudience loves it, and it's really fun to make. - Does it make you a little bit sad that\nthe gaming industry, in general, is moving towards more\nonline, less single-player DLC? Maybe that observation\nis incorrect. But it feels at this moment, to me, it feels like, It's easier to make a lot\nof money with online... - If you get it right. - If you get it right. And so the game\ncompanies are reaching for that. And it just makes me really sad because there's\nso much power to the... What you did with Red Dead Redemption 2, I don't know how during\nthat time you were able to pull that off, but that was like a breath of fresh air.\nOr, in a time where everybody was moving to online and there was\nthat huge incentive to that, you go on and draw, again, the greatest\nnarrative in video game history and the greatest character in video\ngame history, single-player. - We still love single\nplayer games. And I think as we started up Absurd, we\ndid a lot of soul searching. And also a lot of cynical\nlooking at what goes well in the industry. Luckily, if you want\nto do what we're forced to do and also what I want to do, which is make\nnew IP, you need single player games. You can launch a multiplayer\ngame as with new IP. It's just extremely hard. So, luckily, we are focusing on what we're good at,\nwhich is open world single player games. And we might add multiplayer components to one of them. I think\none of them is going to be really tough, later on. But we're still thinking that\nthrough. But I think we're really leaning into single player experience\nas being a strength for us as a company and something we\nlove to do, and I think something a large part of the audience prefers,\nand I'd love to, with all of those, keep single player DLC\none way or another, going. - Were there some other game ideas you\nconsidered while at Rockstar and afterwards? that you didn't go with?\nSo, like, worlds... - Oh, yes - ...or pirate games? I mean, what... I\nwould love to see the notes, the possible options. - Never thought a lot about a pirate game. - Yeah? - My son is obsessed with that game, Sea of\nThieves, at the moment, so he's constantly saying, \"Do a pirate game.\" Haven't really\nthought about it too much. We worked a lot on multiple iterations\nof an open world spy game. - Yeah. - And it never came together. - So Agent? - Agent, and it's had about\nfive different ... iterations - ... so good. - I don't think it works. I concluded I, and I keep thinking about it sometimes. I\nsometimes lie in bed thinking about it, and I've concluded as an open, as\nwhat makes them really good as film stories makes them not work\nas video games. We need to think through how to do it in a\ndifferent way as a video game. - So for people who don't know, it would be\nhypothetically set in the 1970s Cold War era. - That was one of the versions. There was\nanother one that was set in current. We had so many different versions of this game. - Got it. - We worked on so many different teams. - But it would be more\ngeopolitical, like espionage- - That, yeah, espionage, like... - ... and assassinations. - Yeah, assassinations. I don't know what it\nwould've been 'cause it never really... We never got it enough to even do a proper\nstory on it. We're doing the early work as you get the world up and running. It never\nreally found its feet in either of them. - So interesting. - And I sort of think I know why, because one of those films,\nthey're very, very frenetic and they beat to beat to beat. You gotta go\nhere and save the world. You gotta go there and stop that person being killed and\nthen save the world. An open-world game does have moments like that when\nthe story comes together. But for large portions, it's a lot kind of looser, and\nyou're just hanging out and doing what you want. I want freedom. I wanna go over here and do\nwhat I want, and I wanna go over and do what you want. That's why it works well being a criminal, because\nyou fundamentally don't have anyone telling you what to do. We try and create, you know, external agency through these people\nkind of forcing you into the story at times. But as a spy, that doesn't really work\nbecause you have to be against the clock. So I think for me, I question if you can\neven make a good open-world spy game. - So interesting. So you have to be able to\nride around in a car and listen to the radio. - Yeah, and cruise about. - Or ride a horse and just look at nature. - So lots of things would work as open-world\ngames, but I don't know if a spy does. - That's brilliantly put. But to me, there's\nsuch espionage and assassinations and... ...the geopolitical international context\nis so interesting. But you're right. I just wanna listen to what\nis it? Lazlo and, uh... - Yeah. Well, you can't. You gotta save the\nworld. And so you need this time pressure. - With a Russian accent? Or something. Yeah,\nwow. Wow. That's really interesting. - Then we played around with the knights\nconcept that was looking at... - Nice - ...you know, knights, and sort\nof trying to do a version of a mythological game that\ncould have been fun. And you know, still love that idea, but\nnever went very far with it. - Knights would be going\nreally far back in history. - Yeah, it would have to go. It never\ngot to writing any of it. Just did some backstory and played around\nwith a few ideas. But it was always something I thought I would never do, and\nthen kind of fell in love with it a little bit. - You left Rockstar in 2020\nand eventually launched Absurd Ventures, as we've been\ntalking about. What do you miss about your time at Rockstar? Are there specific\nmoments that bring you joy when you think about them? - Of course, it was my whole, you\nknow, it was my life for 20 something years, 21 years or something. It was, and I moved to\nAmerica to do it, and grew up doing it. I was always living in New\nYork. It was at times, very intense and at other times, a magical experience. But it\nwas also just a huge chunk of my life. - The lows and the highs? - And the middles. It was\njust my life, you know? My life was that job and the people\nI knew in New York, and my family. And we were doing something that was\nintense and innovative, and, you know, both loved and hated by wider society in\ndifferent ways and at different times. And in this weird company that was\nconstantly in trouble. So it was really fun. - Just even looking back at that time\nto today, how did you evolve as a creative mind across those 20 years? - Well, I was a child. I\nwas a 25-year-old child. I didn't know anything, and\nI wanted to be a writer. But I still wasn't writing. And I\nbought a notebook and I'd occasionally scribble in it, and I've still got those\nnotebooks somewhere. And I was working in video games, which were the least literary medium it's possible to imagine at the\ntime. There was no room for that on PS1 games, really. Thinking I needed to stop and do something else, but not\nhaving the skills or the confidence to do it. And I'd been doing that in London.\nThen I came to New York, and it was fun, really fun to be in\nNew York and really fun to do a new company in New York. And that was an amazing\nadventure, but I was still lost as a human being. And then when I was 27, I was still completely lost, a child.\nAnd I stopped some of my bad behavior, and the next day pretty much the chance to write on, work on open world games,\nand all the skills I'd half learned over the previous years and my way of thinking, where\nI thought about space a lot because I was a geographer rather than a historian,\ncame together, and I got the chance to work on an open world game. So it felt like it was\nmeant to be. It was fun to explore, but really fun to explore with this team that\nwas, you know, Alex Horton and Navid and Leslie and the guys in\nScotland and all the people in New York, making these new\ngames in this new way. And going, \"Oh, we need to find a hundred voices. We've\ngot no money. How the hell are we going to do that? We'll get everyone's friends in and\njust record all lines of dialogue each as we kind of would invent the way that pedestrians would\nspeak in video games.\" No one else was doing that kind of stuff. It was insane. So I think\nthat that period from kind of 2001, 2005, it was lots of early innovation and felt really exciting\nbecause we were doing new stuff. It didn't feel... It felt creative, but it didn't feel like writing yet. Just becoming that.\nWe felt like we were doing lots of creative things and learning how to assemble the stuff and\nlearning what it could take. And then I think, we talked about it earlier, but the\njourney into doing GTA4 when it began to feel more like a proper\nwriting experience. And I was probably ready for that at that point. And then\nI was like, \"Well, this is better than films. This is something that\nfilms can't do.\" You know, this 360-degree experience of being this\nimmigrant. And it still felt, we were still only scratching the surface. I mean,\nit still feels like that now in some ways, but it still felt a little... And then\nthat five games, you know, GTA 4 and 5, Red Dead 1 and 2, all the extra packs for\nthem, and Max Payne 3. I think we took the games thematically into new places\nthrough that period. From a writing perspective, that was the most exciting\nperiod. From a business and sort of early creativity period, the period 2001\nto 2005 was probably the most exciting. to use the original\nstarting team, all doing well, yeah, personal life\nwas doing okay, didn't feel like such a mess. And then from 2007\nonward, '07, '08, was happy personally. Having children, happily married, and the games were just getting much better. But\nthere were lots of pressure in the business. You know, the budgets got really big,\nso it added to the stress. So there's always good bits and stresses, but,\nyou know, I always just tried to show up and do my best and think about how I\ncould do it in a new way. Always trying to go, \"It's a new medium. What\ncan we do that's new?\" - But as a writer, as a scholar of human nature. First of all, were you\nsurprised that you were actually able, like you had it in\nyou, through humor and tragedy, to create these\nincredibly compelling characters? Because I think I remember reading\nsomewhere that James Joyce, when he was 20, said that he's going to\nbe the greatest writer ever. And I feel like every 20-year-old says\nthis. It's just James Joyce pulls it off. - Yes. - So were you surprised that\nyou were actually able to do it? And how did that person get better\nand better and better at writing as you evolved? - The team got better and better. so we could write in a more ambitious\nway. The animation got better so we could support it in a better way.\nWe could go deeper. I mean, you couldn't go that deep on a PS2 game. So it was\nalso just the technology evolved. Um, I don't know. I felt like I was good at\ndoing it, and I was well-trained for it. I'd been in the right place\nat the right time, and I was both lucky and had a way of\nthinking about characters that when you reduce them to about 10\nsentences, was amusing. I think I was a... And I saw the world in a holistic way. And saw society in a holistic way\nthat you could break apart into an open world video game. I thought\nabout it a bunch. The way I think about things was suitable for that, for\nwhatever reason. That was just good fortune. - Laszlo mentioned that it was another\nlegend who you're still working with. he mentioned that you would lock\nyourself in a room, writing dialogue for radio, I think. You would lock yourself in a room and get\nanchovies and onion pizza and crushed... Diet Cokes. Is this accurate information? - Very accurate. - For which periods of your life\nwas this a fuel for your creative process? Is it anchovies and onion pizza? - I would also get pepperoni on my half.\nJust to be technically accurate. He wouldn't, 'cause he claimed to\nbe a vegetarian in those days. But then he'd admit to me he kept\nchicken wings hidden in the freezer. So he was a sort of fake vegetarian.\nThat was... I think we still do it now sometimes, as a sort of... - Yes. Homage. - ...memorialize. But that began in 2001. And the office at Rockstar\nwas so small and we were so broke that there was no... And I\ndid have a private office at the time, but it genuinely was a\ncupboard. It didn't have a window. It was literally sitting in a cupboard.\nSo there was no room and I had a desk and chair just for myself.\nBut I lived quite near the office, so we would write one or two\nafternoons a week. He'd come in. He was a freelancer working with\nus. He'd come in from Long Island, and then we would jump on the\nsubway, go to my apartment in Chelsea and sit in this grimy little\napartment I was living in and buy pizza from around the corner. And that became,\nyou know, we both liked Diet Coke and pizza. Very video game\ndeveloper. And that became good luck. And there we'd have these good writing\nsessions where we realized we got on well with each other and that we had a similar\nsense of humor and we could write the stuff. And then he would do all of the real work\nproducing it. So it was perfect for me, 'cause I got to outsource most of the real\nwork and he's a brilliant radio producer. So he was a great partner in that way. And\nthen that was how that relationship began. And then I'd get him, I would say, \"Well,\nwe've got to record these 80 voices. Come and help me, 'cause I can't direct 80\npeople at once.\" So he helped with that process and he was a really good producer, like audio,\nlike getting bodies in producers as well as technical producer. So he was just that\nwas the beginning of that relationship. And it was always... My job was to ensure\nthe media content felt like it reflected the tone of the world and we would write it\ntogether, then his job was just to make sure it sounded funny, like he would just\nproduce it in a really funny way. - Just to give a little bit more of\na shout-out to Laszlo, what's it been like working with him for over 20\nyears? He's working with you still. He's this kind of flamboyant, colorful\npersonality. Much loved for being a voice also on radio in the\nGrand Theft Auto games. - Yeah, and the rule was, when he was\nthe character, I would write the first pass of him. So I would... and I would\nget nastier and nastier over time. - Yeah, it's awesome. - So to the point where he's having his head\nshaved and being punished by everybody. But even in game after game, he got worse. ...he began as this quite... In GTA\n3, he's a quite likable character. Over the next 12, 13 years,\nit just got worse and worse. So, I think he's glad not to be doing\nthat anymore, but he did it with great grace. He's just a great partner\nbecause he likes, you know, ...like me, we just like making stuff. He\nlikes to make stuff. He likes to work in new spaces. He's been a great help on\nbringing the comic book to life, doing a lot of the work on that.\nHe's working on that right now. And he's really fun to work with, and he's, you know, always\nwill put creativity first. And he's ridiculous. He's just a really... - In the best possible way, yeah. Outside of the games you've\nparticipated and created, what do you think are some candidates\nfor the greatest game of all time? - Tetris. - Tetris. - Tetris Game Boy. No question. - Tetris and the Game Boy, yeah. - It was the perfect device for playing that\ngame. I never liked it as much on anything else. When my wife was trying\nto get a retro one for my kids, trying to get them\nfor Christmas right now. It was the most addicted I ever was to\nanything in my life, of far too many addictions. I was obsessed by it,\ndreaming about it, and when you link two together with the cable and if I got four, it\nwould push yours forward. It was like the perfect game design. So from a pure puzzle\nperspective, nothing comes close. - Yes. Extremely simple. Pure\ngameplay. No narrative. - No, nothing. No personality at all.\nIt's a completely different thing. - Perfection. - But perfect in its way. Open World\ngames can't be that perfect. But you always dream of\nmaking something like that. - And Super Mario. - I think the N64 ones. All of those early 3D games were very\namazing when you first saw them. On the N64, PS1, when you went,\nit suddenly was like these games, they're alive, and they're\nbelievable in a different way. I think that was very interesting. - It looks nothing like anything else. - Nintendo has that look,\ndoesn't it? Always. - Yeah. I think that's the, they're known for this Nintendo polish,\nof every pixel has a purpose. - Yes. - And I mean, I suppose Tetris\nhas that same real focus on delivering a pure gaming experience with as little as possible. It's really\nbeautiful. And of course, Zelda really pioneered a lot of sort\nof the feeling of... ...of a world, but it's\nnot quite open world. - No, but it's amazing. It's almost like... the new ones, they almost, to me,\nfeel like Hitchcock. They're just speaking the language of video games, you know.\nLike, you know everything's going to work this way and that way. It's quite\nsystemic, but it's so, how it all glues together is so amazing. It feels\nlike when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality. He's speaking the\nlanguage of cinema in a very, very strong, with a very strong accent\nalmost. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all. And that's what those\nZelda games kind of feel like to me. They are these amazing things that could only\nbe video games. They couldn't be anything else. - For me, another really powerful open\nworld is The Elder Scrolls world. It's role-playing, it's fantasy,\ndragons, all that kind of stuff. - Todd is great at what he does. It is.\nThey're slightly, they're more... I mean, from a technical perspective,\nwe're always involved. I mean, with the new games, we're\nconstantly trying to find the balance between, you know, an RPG,\na role-playing game, and an action game. And then, you know, try to go,\n\"Well, an action-adventure game with RPG elements.\" And what does that mean? And I think\nthey've all kind of moved into roughly the same space. But for me, it always just comes\ndown to, are... is it easy to play? Are our mechanics super slick? And then can we\nkeep our dialogue feeling very alive? Like, I'm not always a great...\nFor just what we do, I like when other people do it. For what we do,\nwe always want very punchy dialogue. So, don't give big trees, but\nstill have it interactive. So we're going to lose a touch of interactivity,\nbut we'll still have the dialogue feeling like it's alive. But we'll get\nbetter at dialogue, and it'll feel a slightly more cinematic experience. - Yeah, I think The Elder Scrolls\nseries has almost always leaned a little more towards the open world. - Yes, they're real RPGs. You know, we've\nnot... The games that I've worked on, they've not really\nbeen RPGs. They've had RPG elements onto a story-driven\naction game. It's kind of just a slightly different emphasis, but I still think\nwhat they do is amazing, and he's brilliant at doing. - And I think Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and Skyrim are\ngames where you have millions of people that just walk\naround or drive around. - Mm-hmm. And feel the world. - Feel the world. Just feel the world. - And The Witcher, same thing. - And Baldur's Gate 1, 2, and\n3, really interesting. They really tried to make every choice that you make genuinely branch the game,\nto where it's not the illusion of choice, it's really... - Nothing. Yeah. - It's really, choice really does\nsomething, and that's really hard to pull off technically. - Yes, and hard to pull off.\nYou're always sort of debating the sweet spot between\nthat and a strong story. You know, and strong mechanics. It's\nhard to get them all, and you know as a As a game-making team,\nthe whole team kind of have to figure out where they\nwant to fall on that line. - On a difficult topic, you dedicated\nthe book to your mom and dad. And in particular, you wrote, \"To my\nfather, who died while I was finishing the book.\" What have you learned\nabout life from your dad? - To show up. To be present. To\ngo to work every day. To love creative things. He was a lawyer,\nbut he was also a jazz musician, and he did both to the best of\nhis abilities. To value family as more important than either of those\nthings. He was a present guy, I think. And, you know, he loved books,\nalways loved books, always loved films, loved music. He wasn't into video games,\nbut liked that we were doing weird things. - Was he proud of you? - Yeah, I think so. I hope\nso. He was, for a lawyer... He really venerated at some\nlevel, giving \"the man\" the finger. Like, whenever life goes crazy— he was always on the side of the\nunderdog and the ridiculous. And I think that, you know, he\nalways wanted to answer people back, always give the silly\ncomment. I certainly have taken that from him, to my detriment\nprobably, but it makes life more fun. He always would just say the obnoxious\nthing and just didn't give a fuck. And that was, I think that\nwas probably quite inspiring. - So you have a bit of that in you? - Unfortunately so, yes. Not good at\nshutting up, not good at toeing the line. - I think I speak for most\nof human civilization that fortunately you have\nthat as part of who you are, because it comes\nthrough your stories. - I think it made school difficult. They\nsent me to this very formal school— that was like, it might as well\nhave been set in the 1870s, in the 1990s. And, but then, I\nalways got in trouble just for... not doing anything that\nwrong, just answering teachers back all of the time. I couldn't be quiet. - How often do you think about mortality?\nAre you personally afraid of death? - Well, my father passed away in May, so a\nlot more since then, obviously. I mean, I think about it a lot. Am I afraid of it? I don't know. Some days intensely and some\ndays not at all. I would love to stay alive long enough to see my kids\nproperly grow up and settled, of course, for them. Aside\nfrom that, some days I feel, you know, spiritually connected\nto the universe and not afraid of death at all. And other\ndays I feel like a sort of random piece of good luck\nwho's gonna get struck down by an angry fate and turn to\nnothingness, and that terrifies me. - What do you think about the nothingness? I\nmean, that- that in itself is terrifying. - Yeah, that is terrifying.\nI mean, I tend to, I tend to, you know, I've spent long\nperiods of my life tormented by that stuff. The last few years, I tend to\nbelieve there is a purpose and a point to life, and that\nwe have some kind of spiritual or soul-based existence. I'm\nnot quite sure if it matters if there is a God or not, we should probably\nlive our lives the same way either way. But I tend to think that, you\nknow, there is a metaphysical purpose to life and part of the,\nthat purpose is to, you know, search for the purpose. But at\nother points you know, if you read too much science, you get wrapped\nup in the nothingness of it all. - Also, there's a component to\nyour brain. When talking about Wuthering Heights by Emily Brontë,\nyou said that you have been, by fortune, struck with a\nbit of a capacity for the grandiosity of feeling. So you\nfeel the world deeply, sometimes romantic, sometimes overly\nromantic. You've said, I like this line, \"Feelings may destroy you, but\nthey're the best thing we have.\" So that ability to feel the world, is that a gift\nor a curse for you? What do you think? - That's a really interesting question because\nit's obviously both. At times it's both, or at times it's one or the other. When\nthings are going well, when you feel alive, when you feel like you're\nconnected to things, when you're seeing beauty in people and joy in\nexperiences, of course it's it's wonderful. When you're\nfeeling like, you know, bereft and set adrift by the world and that you can't\nconnect to it in some way and you're lost and abandoned by God or consciousness or fate or whatever\nit is, it's awful. You know, when I feel like a dreadful hack, which is most of the time,\nyou know, it's terrible. You'd rather not be doing this rubbish. And then sometimes you're working\ncreatively and it feels good and you feel like you're doing the right thing and it feels\nfantastic, but that's not very often. - Do you think it's possible to\nhave one without the other? - No. No, of course not. When I think\nabout growing up to the extent that I am capable of growing up it is about accepting the bad\nwith the good from any situation or any aspect of myself. You know, going,\n\"Okay, it's not perfect. I'm not perfect.\" - You said you often feel\nlike a hack. Is that that self-critical part of your brain,\nis that a feature or a bug? - That's an, I think it's that new thing that\nwe're gonna lean into, the bug feature. It's both, isn't it? I mean,\nit cannot lead... That self-critical brain, I think lots of\npeople suffer from it, and I think the internet is designed to induce, if you\ndidn't have it before, you will have it after being online. It clearly can become a bug but it also can give you drive\nand a lack of complacency, so it can also become a feature. - I had a pretty intense argument\nwith Paul Conti, who's a legendary psychiatrist, student of the\nmind, about this. He worked with many famous creative people and\nhe thinks that that negative voice is not at all needed for creative genius. And I thought,\n\"I know awfully a lot of creative people that have that voice.\" - I'd rather not have it, but I certainly\nhave lived with it this far. There's a danger that negativity... For me, that negativity and consciousness become\nthe same thing, you know? Sometimes I have to fight to not just\nbe perpetually negative, and that can be part of the human struggle\nfor lots of people and certainly has been for me. I think if you're trying\nto do, you know, good stuff and you're reflective,\ninevitably, and, you know, you live in this world of constant,\nconstant criticisms by the internet. Of course, you know, everyone\nwho ever puts something on the internet, be it a picture of themselves or any\nkind of work they've made or whatever it is, is going to get 50 good comments\nand one bad comment. Remember the bad comment. So that, and that, that becomes\nfuel for the negative voice. I don't know anyone that's strong enough not to. You know,\nwe all, you know, at some level you should just measure that stuff in weight, not in\nquality. But of course we just focus on the quality. - And I do think in general, as you get older,\nthat's the real challenge for people. You can see the different trajectories\npeople choose to take. But it's easy to slip into cynicism\nand negativity, into this, Dostoevsky's Notes from Underground, nihilistic kind of worldview.\nI think the heroic action to take with time is to become more\noptimistic, to see more good. I think that- - I agree. - There's probably a hero's journey of\nbeing extremely self-critical at first, for the first, maybe half of your\nlife or two-thirds, and then, while maintaining some self-critical\naspects just so you stay humble, start to see the\ngood in everything around you, in other people, in the world,\nand even maybe every once in a while on a weekend, in yourself. - I hope so. I mean, that's what\nI've been, I could not be more cynical. I think you put that beautifully. - Yeah. - I could not be more cynical than\nI was as a child. You know, I could not see goodness anywhere. I\ncouldn't see, you know, I don't think late 1970s to early 1990s\nEngland was a great, was a place of great, you know,\noptimism and naiveté. It was brutal. And I was brutal, I\nwas brutal within it. And I think I've become much more naive, and tried to become more innocent\nin some ways, and always try to see the flawed good in people.\nYou know, I've tried to, or I've had to force myself to be like that because,\nyou know, the other way is not fun, it's not nice. It's not\nnice to not be nice. - As a brief aside, you had a\nwonderful conversation with Ryan McCaffrey at LA Comic-Con.\nI've been a big fan of his for a long time. He writes amazing\nstuff at IGN and he has a great podcast. Everybody should go listen to it.\nI really enjoyed it. Plus I get to attend a Comic-Con and just be there in the\naudience. And like we were saying offline, the LA Comic-Con, it's the first Comic-Con\nI've been to, there's just all kinds of real genuine nerds, good-hearted- - Oh, it's fascinating. Yeah, brilliant. - It's just so much kindness and goodness and just simple joy in being\na fan of a thing was there. - Yeah, which is what those\nthings are all about. - Yeah. Okay, so let's talk about some\nof the greatest books of all time. And I should also give a shout-out to\nan excellent podcast he did with Sonia Walger, who's a friend of yours,\nbut she had a great podcast. She has guests pick their five favorite,\nmost impactful books and so on. You picked five fiction books,\none for each decade of your life. For the audience, they should\ngo listen to that conversation. But you picked Winter\nHoliday by Arthur Ransome. Second one was Wuthering\nHeights by Emily Brontë. Then Tender Is the Night by F.\nScott Fitzgerald, The Thin Red Line by James Jones, and\nMiddlemarch by George Eliot. But just zooming out, reflecting back on\nthat conversation, what do you think, if an alien came, what are\nsome candidates for books that you would recommend to them? - Middlemarch. It's the best\nnovel written in English. War and Peace is one of the best novels\nwritten in Russian, I would argue. I think both of those are... Because if you've only got one\nbook, you want a long book. - Yeah, true. - And then they're both\nbooks that kind of... It's something I was always trying to put\ninto games, and you know, that feeling of all of life is here. You know, you've\ngot love, death, violence, romance, the whole human experience in different\nways. So I think there's something amazing about, you know, Vanity Fair, I used\nto love the novel, not the magazine. Because same thing, all of life is here. - You also spoke highly of F.\nScott Fitzgerald and Hemingway. - I was obsessed by them in my 20s. - Yeah. - Completely obsessed. - As one must be. - Yeah. - Absolutely. - At that age, and I think them\nas a double act is so amazing. You know, one helped discover the other\nand then died first, and then suddenly died in obscurity and then\nwas rediscovered as a genius while the other one was still\nalive and falling into decline, I think their relationship\nis itself very novelistic. - That, by the way, is a\nphenomenon of writing maybe no longer, maybe still, you know, people\nlike Franz Kafka who died in obscurity. All these writers who die in\nobscurity. Nobody knows them and they become famous later. That is just so\ninteresting. That's such an interesting... You know, Franz Kafka. Kafka in particular is fascinating because\nhe wanted all of his work to be burned, like destroyed. So that,\nspeaking of the critical voice, and I think he's one of the, one of the best writers of the\n20th century. Of course, the dystopian novels are really\ninteresting: 1984, Brave New World. - Love 1984. Had never listened\nto it or read it, and then I think I did it on Talking Book, or I maybe\nread it, I can't remember, during COVID. I think I did both, became obsessed by\nit. And it's got the elements of that creeping into A Bed of\nParadise. But it's so good. I hadn't realized how good it was. - Yes. - And it's so of the moment. - It's almost like because\nof its fame, and... it's almost like cliché, and\nyou take away the character- - Yeah, if it were English...\nAnd I remember the year 1984- and you're like, \"This is...\" I remember\nthe song. You know? It's just too much. - Yeah. Too much. - It can't be that good. And then it was that.\nI came to it completely cold, just, \"Oh, I should work my way through this 'cause it's\nanother classic I haven't read.\" And then it's incredible. - And the book I've read more than any other\nbook is Animal Farm by George Orwell. I don't know why exactly, but the childlike\nfairy tale-telling of totalitarianism. - Well, you grew up in a communist country. - Yeah. Maybe that's it. The roots of it. - You know, I remember, I was\na kid in the Cold War in London. And we were always terrified of\nEastern Europeans, \"You're gonna come and kill us all.\" And then I ended up marrying a\nPole. And I was... We were... And we had Ukrainians, you know, who\nworked for us and worked with us. And I was... We were sitting,\na few years ago, sitting around a campfire in Upstate New York,\nwith the campfire built by our old nanny's husband, who's\nUkrainian, and he'd been in the Red Army. I was like, history is so strange that you\nend up... The Red Army used to be the ultimate enemy. And like, we're now just hanging\nout with... It's like, everything changes. You think these things are\npermanent, and they're really not. You know, and we face some of that now, where you\nthink these structures are permanent, and they're gonna change. - And you also mentioned that the three\ngreat World War II books are The Thin Red Line, Life and Fate by Vasily Grossman. And The End of the Affair, Graham\nGreene. What makes for a great war book? - I think World War II is interesting because it affects everywhere,\nobviously. And so you can get all these different kinds of stories. And there's so many good...\nI was just trying to come up with a range of one American, one British, one Eastern European just to get different\nperspectives. But there's so many amazing World War II books\naround all kinds of stories. I think the most complete one, because it\nis this all of life being there, probably is Life and\nFate, which is amazing. - It was written by Vasily Grossman.\nHe experienced Stalingrad firsthand. And there's also just a deep\nphilosophical component. - And the bit in Treblinka is one of the\nmost harrowing sections of any book I ever read. And it really, almost more than any\nother piece of art around the Holocaust, made me feel what you would feel like at that moment. I\nmean, it's just incredible piece of humanism. - And also, I mean, Man's Search\nfor Meaning by Viktor Frankl. - Yeah. Oh, yeah. - It seems like that context\nreveals, in the most pure way, human nature and like what\nkind of... You know, in Man's Search for Meaning is when everything is taken\nfrom you, you know, the little remains of love for, in\nthis case, his wife... is the thing that is a\nlittle flame that burns. And let's say your Grossman\nis small acts of kindness, is the thing that allows the\nhuman spirit to persist. - I love the bit in Life and Fate when\nyou get... Obviously, it's in this Stalinist period, and so they're all losing... They all know that what\nthey thought was going to be wonderful about the revolution isn't\ngoing to happen. So everyone's scared of being killed by Stalin 'cause it's\npost the purges. But then you get these guys and they're trapped\nin a building, fighting in Stalingrad. And so they know\nat this moment they're dead anyway. And they get to\nlive like pure, perfect Marxist communists away from Stalin and\nall his nonsense. And I thought that section's incredible 'cause you realize\nin some ways, in all of its horrors, the most disappointing thing about the 20th\ncentury, in some ways, was the absolute failure of communism. You know? 'Cause\nit was such a, you know, quote-unquote beautiful idea and it just did\nnot work time and time again. And these people who fought\nfor it and then saw it not working, I think they're sort of\nfascinating characters. You know, all of the revolutionaries from 1917 that were then killed by Stalin,\nwhich was all of them apart from him, him and Lenin. - And that was, you know, people in modern\nday politics talk about communism like it's trivial, it's trivial\nthat it would lead to atrocities. But I don't think it's that trivial.\nIt's this idealism of humans. It's like, why, you know, why\ncan't... Basically, why can't we all get along? There's a real compassion behind\nit. There's real love. And what you realize is there is... It's a real study, the\n20th century, of human nature. that, unfortunately, at scale, that\nkind of compassion is abused by centralized power. So there's a\ndictator always, in that context, given that set of technologies, a\ndictator arises and does the opposite of what the promise of the\nideal is supposed to be. - Well, I think I thought a lot about that then because I was taught by all these\ndisappointed communists, you know? After '89, all of these English communists,\nyou know, were all like having to access, discovering all these atrocities\nthat happened. You know, so it always fascinated me. And then you think about\ncomplexities or where one's own values are in the modern moment. And I say,\nyou know, without from every and whether either of them, what we would\ncall left now or call right now, does it have any bearing on the sort of communist\nera of those words? And I would say probably not. I think things have changed. But\nfundamentally, the one value that I would think is worth\nfighting for is, whenever either side starts to move towards\nthought control, move away. That's never the right outcome. The\nnever right outcome is, \"Oh, you've said the wrong thing. You should be\nremoved now.\" That should never ever be a thing we should lean towards. - Yeah, it does seem like freedom,\nindividual freedom, is a prerequisite for - for happiness - for happiness, and the\nflourishing of a larger society. So there's, like you said, 1984 is\npretty. I mean, it's a caricature. - But it is brilliant. - It's quite, it's actually also just\na good story. That's my criticism of Brave New World, it's just\npoorly written. But I like Brave New World probably applies more\nto the 21st century than does 1984. So, - I don't know. I think 1984, with the\nfake wars, and the way that it revealed everything in it was a setup for him. There's something that if he could've seen the\nInternet. There's something of, it's like an analog internet, that world they\nbuild around the main character. - What advice would you give\nto a young person today about, let's say, a career?\nHow to have a career they can be proud of? How they can have a life to be\nproud of? You've had a non-standard life. - I've had a lucky life in which I have fought to mess things up, and\nfate has always thrown me a bone. - You've traveled in South America and\nhad hobos chase you with machetes. - Yeah. Once. - Yeah, yeah. So that happened. - That was a series of poor life decisions. And I ran, I ran away. You know,\nI ran away to South America. That was a poor decision. I ran\naway from the guy with a knife. That was a good decision. I came to\nAmerica. That was a good decision. I came to LA, that's, I\nthink, been a good decision. It's been fun to see a different side\nof America and be in a different creative environment. LA is\nstill amazing for creativity and entertainment, the wider entertainment\nindustry stuff. I think that's been fun. What would I say? I would say, when you get a chance, take it.\nThat was one thing I did do well. When I got chances, I\nwas good at taking them. I would say, do not worry\ntoo young about your career. I would say, worry about having a\nrounded intellectual inner life, 'cause you're gonna spend your whole\nlife in your own head. So the more interesting you find your own head, the\nmore interesting you find the world, the less you're gonna annoy\nyourself. So I would say, I would, I would say, do not do a vocational\ndegree as an undergraduate. That's been my... I would say,\ndo something else. Do something, you know, random and then focus\nafterwards. That would be, I think I was advocating against the obsession that\npeople had about four years ago with STEM subjects. And now AI is gonna make\nthem all irrelevant anyway, perhaps. So, you know, it's interesting\nto see everything changes. Jobs are not that hard. You\nknow, turn up, be enthusiastic. Be, but turn up in person, be\nenthusiastic. Help people. Say, \"You'll be fine in any\njob.\" People is, you know. - Did you always know when the chance to take\nshowed up? Like this is, okay, this is interesting, this is\nnew, this is different? - Not always, no. But the big times\nwere the chance to move to America. For me, that was a big moment.\nMy life was a mess in... - That was weird timing. So I read that\nSam wrote you an email. What, what... in South America? - I literally, I was in South America... ...in Colombia where there\nwas a war raging there. I was making a series of very poor life\nchoices and a lack of life skills, age 25. My latest poor choice was to get up too\nearly, because the police didn't start work till 9:00, but the muggers started\nat 8:00. And so I was out walking along the beach at 8:00 and these... guys, this Rasta who turned up, who\nI'd been talking to the day before, started trying to talk to me. And\nthen two guys came up to talk to him, and I couldn't tell... if they were trying to mug him 'cause he\nowed them money or he brought me to them. But I did notice one of them had a machete\nand the other had a kind of broken gun. So I thought, \"This is not good.\" And I ran\noff, sprinted down the beach in my silly shoes. And got the chance, for once in my life, to run over to\na road, jump into a taxi and scream, \"Take me anywhere!\" I felt\nlike I'm in an action movie, and a guy's chasing after with a machete. The taxi\ndriver looks back, sees the dude with the machete, and goes, \"?\" And I'm, \"No, no,\nno, they're not my friends.\" \"Get me out of here.\" He drove me\nup the street into a bit where the town was. It's kind of between the old\ntown and the new town in Cartagena. And I got out of the car and then cut my\nfoot on a rock. That was the sum total of my injuries. Then I went to an\ninternet café, cause this was probably late '98, and got the\nchance to come and work on a game for six weeks in New York. And\nI was like, \"Well, if I stay in South America much longer, I'm going to get myself\nkilled,\" 'cause this was when I was getting into silly stuff. And so I went to New York, and they were\njust starting Rockstar. I got to sort of write the mission statements and\nwhatnot there, and help set the tone for that and just ended up\nstaying. I had to come and go a bit while all visas got sorted\nout. And then I just ended up staying, \"I'll stay for a year 'cause\nNew York's pretty fun.\" It actually was not that-- this was the height of\nGiuliani before he was a maniac. So you couldn't-- when you went to bars,\nyou were told you couldn't dance. 'Cause they were trying to clamp\ndown on New York being fun. So it was actually less fun than London, but\nthere's still a great energy in New York. And I got exposed to the kind of\nmadness of New York capitalism. - By the way, as we hear sirens in the background,\nthat always makes me think of New York. - Yeah, of course. - Whenever I'm in New York... - Yeah - ...there's always sirens. - Steam coming out the floor, people screaming\nat you. I mean, you get people screaming at you in LA, at least. - Yeah, but it's more\ndistributed, it's more, uh... - Yeah, it's more spread out. - ...spread out, yeah. - You can get a bit more quiet here. I love the energy. It was great\nto work hard and then be able to go out for dinner late. And New York was\nreally, really a fun experience for me. - You worked with your brother, Sam,\nfor many years. What do you admire about him as a creative\nmind, as a human being? - His drive and his vision early\non to see what video games could become. He was the one who\nunderstood that video games were the next big thing. And I think\nthat was, you know, people would laugh in our face about that in those\ndays. To have someone that was strong and saying, \"No, no, we stick, stay\nthe course,\" and then having the confidence to push through\nwith these big projects. - Are you excited for the\nfuture of video games? - Yeah, completely. I still look... I'm glad\nyou've spoken so, I mean, you've spoken so kindly about our work, about the stuff that I did, and the stuff the whole\nteams did. It's wonderful. But I just look at it and see problems and see things\nthat we can make do better. You know, I think it was always, try each time to do it\nbetter. And some of the stuff we're working on now is going to do stuff that people haven't really seen before. I\nthink it's just, I think that games can get so much better.\nThey can feel so much more alive. They can be better at storytelling\nand feel more alive and feel like, you know, their systems, all\nthe stuff, the component parts we talked about. We can make\neach of those parts better. and tie them together better. I think the\ntechnology still feels like it's only just beginning. Cinema evolved from, like,\n1900, 1895, whenever it was, until they invented talking in 1930 or\nwhenever that was. It's not that. Then it kind of found its modern form,\nand then by '39, they're shooting in color. Basically, a modern film\nis no different from a 1939 film. But with games, I still think\nwe've got a long way to go. The tech... There are so many different parts of the\ntech that still have a long way to go, and you can go in all\ndifferent fun directions. - I just wish... and I know you said\nvideo games take a lot less than they could, but I just wish it was faster.\nLike, you've already made me... - Me too - fall in love with Absurdiverse and you've\nmade me fall in love with The Better Paradise, and now I'm going to sit\ndepressed, realizing we'll have to wait. I could, of course, read. - Well, we should have some little\nshort cartoons coming out in a while for Absurdiverse and more\nstuff coming in the next period. But yeah, it just takes\na little bit of time. I mean, big movies are four years\nplus from start to end. You know, with all the legal stuff at\nthe start. We'll be about the same. - Yeah, and certain movies from idea\nto completion, I mean, take 10 plus years for some of the greats. - Yeah, often. A lot of that is\njust that development process. that is really... Sometimes it feels\nlike it's designed to not make stuff. - A bit more specific advice, but on the\ntopic of video games, what advice would you give to maybe independent video game creators that are dreaming\nof creating great games? They're inspired by Red\nDead. They're inspired by all the incredible open worlds and\nnarratives you've created. How's it possible to have a chance at\ndoing something like that? - I mean, it's part of... There's two\nways: try and do it cheaply with yourself and a small group, or\njoin a company that you think is doing it the right way, you know? And\nI think there's upsides to either of those. I think if you want\nto make something that's cinematic... Yeah, AI is going to change\nsome of this. But if you want to make something that's cinematic, you need resources. You can\nstill make something that's really interesting that isn't super cinematic, but it's an interesting\nexperience in some ways. But the second you're involving actors and motion capture\nand one of those big experiences, it's going to cost some money. So therefore, if\nyou want to do that, you've got to figure out what companies you want to work at and\nfigure out how you get to work there. - Do you have hope for AI\nhelping with some of the video generation, some of the world generation, or some of the open world\nassistance in generating the world? - Yes. Limited. Absolutely, if\nused correctly, it will be a great tool. If used incorrectly, it\nwill lead to loads of generic stuff. You know, I've been in games for\n29 years and all the time, the piece of tech that's going to make making games\nmuch easier and much cheaper is about to turn up, and all that's happened is the games\nhave got much better and way more expensive. So I'm always nervous about saying,\n\"Finally, we have that bit of tech that makes our lives easier,\" but it looks as if\nit might be able to do that when you use it in the right way. If you use it, you know, if\nyou use it to try and as a substitute for creativity, it's going\nto be really generic. - A big ridiculous question. What's the\nmeaning of this whole thing we have going on here, of life, of\nexistence? Why are we here? - To watch the universe.\nThe easiest plausible answer is we are designed by\nthe universe to watch itself and to comment on it in interesting ways. - Consistently more and more\ninteresting ways. Yeah. What role does love play as part of that? - It's the only thing that\nmakes it possibly worth doing. Everything else,\neverything material is irrelevant. So the only things of\nvalue are these immaterial things. You know, I do think metaphysics\nalways trumps physics for me. - Well, Dan, from the bottom of my\nheart, speaking of love, thank you. - What a pleasure. Thank you, man. - Thank you for everything you've created in\nthis world. Me and millions of die-hard fans of your games are forever\ngrateful. I know there's a lot of people that would like\nto say thank you to you. - Just to be clear, 'cause I always\nlike to make this very clear-- ...it was never me. It was always me sat alongside\npeople with actual real talent who did amazing things. - Well, I hope you keep being\nself-critical and creating awesome stuff in the world. And we can't wait to keep exploring the worlds\nyou create. And thank you so much for talking today, brother. - Thank you for having me. What a privilege. - Thanks for listening to this conversation\nwith Dan Houser.
