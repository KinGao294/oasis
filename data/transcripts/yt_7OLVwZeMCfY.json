  "full_text": "- We all have the capacity to kill people\nand murder people and do other terrible things. The question is why we don't\ndo those things rather than why we do those things quite often. Most men have\nfantasized about killing someone, about 70% in two studies, and\nmost women as well. More than 50% of women have fantasized\nabout killing somebody. So murder fantasies are incredibly common. - The following is a conversation\nwith Julia Shaw, a criminal psychologist who has written\nextensively on a wide variety of topics that explore\nhuman nature, including psychopathy, violent crime,\npsychology of evil, police interrogation, false memory\nmanipulation, deception detection, and human sexuality. Her books include Evil, about the psychology\nof murder and sadism, The Memory Illusion, about\nfalse memories, Bi, about bisexuality, and her new book\nthat you should definitely go order now called Green\nCrime, which is a study of the dark underworld of\npoachers, illegal gold miners, corporate frauds,\nhitmen, and all kinds of other environmental criminals. Julia is a brilliant and kindhearted person\nwith whom I got the chance to have many great conversations with on\nand off the mic. This was an honor and a pleasure. This is Lex Fridman\nPodcast. To support it, please check out our sponsors in the\ndescription where you can also find links to contact me, ask\nquestions, give feedback, and so on. And now, dear friends, here's Julia\nShaw. You wrote the book Evil: The Science Behind Humanity's Dark Side.\nSo lots of interesting topics to cover here. Let's start\nwith the continuum. You described that evil is a continuum.\nIn other words, the dark tetrad: psychopathy, sadism, narcissism, Machiavellianism, are a continuum\nof traits, not a binary zero-one label of monster or non-monster.\nSo, can you explain this continuum? - Yeah. So, each trait on the Dark\nTetrad, as it's called, which is the four traits that are associated with dark\npersonality traits. So, things that we often associate with the word \"evil,\"\nlike sadism, which is a pleasure in hurting other people. Machiavellianism,\nwhich is doing whatever it takes to get ahead. Narcissism, which is\ntaking too much pleasure in yourself and seeing\nyourself as superior to others. And then there's\npsychopathy. Psychopathic personalities specifically\noften lack in empathy, and it's usually characterized by\na number of different traits including a parasitic lifestyle, so\nmooching off of others. Deceptiveness, lying to people, and again, that\nempathy dimension where you are more comfortable hurting other people because\nyou don't feel sad when other people feel sad. Now, all of those\ntraits: psychopathy, sadism, Machiavellianism, and\nnarcissism, all of them have a scale. And so you can be low on each\nof those traits or you can be high on each of those traits. And what the Dark\nTetrad is, it's actually a way of classifying people into those who\nmight be more likely to engage in risky behaviors or harmful behaviors\nand those who are not. And if you score high on all of them, you're most\nlikely to harm other people. But each of us score somewhere. So,\nI might score low on sadism but higher on narcissism. And\nin all of them, I'm probably subclinical. And so this is the\nother thing we often talk about in psychology is that there's clinical\ntraits and clinical diagnoses, like someone is diagnosed as having narcissism. Or they're subclinical,\nwhich is you don't quite meet the threshold, but you have traits that are\nrelated, and that are so important for us to understand in the same context. - So, early in the book, you raised the\nquestion that I think you highlight is a very important question: if you could\ngo back in time, would you kill baby Hitler? This is somehow a\ndefining question. Can you explain? - Well, it's about whether you think\nthat people are born evil. So the question of \"Would you kill baby Hitler?\"\nis meant to be something that gets people chatting about whether or not they\nthink that people are born with the traits that make them capable of extreme harm\ntowards others. Or whether they think it's socialized, whether it's something\nthat, maybe in how people are raised, sort of manifests over time. With Hitler, we know from\ncertainly psychologists who have pored over his traits over time and\nlooked at who he was over the course of his life, there's always\nthis question of, \"Was he mad or bad?\" And the answer to \"Was he\nmad?\" Well, he certainly had some characteristics that\npeople would associate with, for example, maybe sadism, with this idea that he was less high on empathy\nis probably also showcased in his work. But in terms\nof whether he was born that way, I think the answer usually would be\nno. And actually, in his early life, he didn't showcase quite a lot of the traits\nthat later defined the horrors that he was capable of. So would I go back in\ntime and kill baby Hitler? The answer is no because I don't think it's a\nstraight line from baby to adult, and I don't think people are born evil. - So you think a large part of\nit is nurture versus nature, the environment shaping\nthe person to become, to manifest the evil that they\nbring out to the world? - Well, and I'd be careful with using the word\nevil because I think we shouldn't use it to describe human beings because it\nmost commonly \"others\" people. In fact, I think it makes us capable\nof perpetrating horrendous crimes against those we label\nevil. So for me, that word is the end of a conversation.\nIt's when we call somebody evil, we say, \"This person is so different\nfrom me that I don't even need to bother trying to understand why they\nare capable of doing terrible things because I would never do such\nthings. I am good.\" And so that artificial differentiation between\ngood and evil is something that, certainly with the book, I'm trying\nto dismantle. And that's why introducing continuums for different kinds\nof negative traits is really important, and introducing this idea that\nthere's nothing fundamental to people that makes them capable of\ngreat harm. We all have the capacity to kill people and murder\npeople and do other terrible things. The question is, why we don't do those things\nrather than why we do those things quite often. So I think humanizing and understanding that we all have these traits\nis the most important thing in my book, certainly. - Yeah, I think a prerequisite of doing evil, I see this in war\na lot, is to dehumanize the other. In order to be able to\nmurder them on scale, you have to reformulate the war as a fight\nbetween good and evil. And the interesting thing you\nsee with war is both sides think that it's a battle of\ngood versus evil. It almost always is like that, especially\nat large-scale wars. - That's right, and on top of dehumanization,\nthere is also this other thing called de-individuation, which is\nwhere you see yourself as part of the group, and you no longer see yourself\nas an individual. And so, it's this fight of us versus them. And so you need\nboth of those things. You need that sort of collapse of empathy for other\npeople, the people who are on the other side. And you need this idea\nthat you can be swallowed by the group, and that gives you a sense of also the cloak of justice,\nthe cloak of morality, even when, you know, maybe you're on the\nwrong side. And that's where, I mean, getting into sort of who's on the right side of\neach war is always a more complicated issue. But certainly calling other people\nevil and calling the other side evil and dehumanizing them is crucial\nto most of these kinds of fights. - Yeah, you promote empathy as an\nimportant thing to do when we're trying to understand each other, and then\na lot of people are uncomfortable with empathy when it\ncomes to folks that we traditionally label as evil.\nHitler's an example. To have empathy means that you're\nsomehow dirtying yourself by the evil. What's your case for\nempathy, even when we're talking about some of the darker\nhumans in human history? - My case for empathy, or evil empathy, as I\nsometimes call it, so empathy for people who we often call evil... Also, the\ntitle of my book is Evil, or in the UK market, it's Making Evil, which is a reference\nto a Nietzsche quote, which is, \"Thinking evil is making evil.\" The idea being\nthat evil is a label we place onto others. There's nothing inherent\nto anything that makes it evil. And so, I also think that\nwe need to dismantle that and empathize with people we call evil\nbecause if we're saying that this is the worst kind of act or worst kind of\nmanifestation of what somebody can be, so if someone can destroy others,\ntorture others, hurt others... I work as a criminal\npsychologist, so I work a lot on sexual abuse cases, on rape\ncases, on murder trials. And so, in those contexts, that word\nevil is used all the time. So, this person is evil. And if we're\ndoing that, then we need to go, okay, but what we actually want is, we don't\nreally just want to label people. We want to stop that behavior from happening, and\nthe only way we're going to do that is if we understand what led that\nperson to come to that situation and to engage in that behavior.\nAnd so, that's why evil empathy, I think, is crucial, because ultimately what we\nwant is to make society safer. And the only way we can do that is to understand\nthe psychological and social levers that led them to engage in this\nbehavior in the first place. - On a small tangent, I get to\ninterview a bunch of folks that a large number of people\nconsider evil. So, how would you give advice about how to conduct such interviews\nwhen you're sitting in front of a world leader that some millions\nof people consider evil? Or if you're sitting in\nfront of people that are actual, like convicted criminals, what's the way\nto conduct that interview? Because to me, I want to understand that\nhuman being. They also have their own narrative about why\nthey're good and why they're misunderstood, and they have a story in which\nthey're not evil and they're going to try to tell that story. And some of them\nare exceptionally good at telling that story. So, if it's for public consumption,\nhow would you do that interview? - I think it's important to speak\nwith people whom we or who a lot of people dehumanize, including myself. I\nmean, I also speak with people who I think are or have... I know have\ncommitted terrible crimes, and I've spoken to these people because, as a criminal\npsychologist, that's often part of my job. So, what's interesting, I think, when\nyou're speaking to people who have committed really terrible crimes, or\ncertainly who've been convicted of terrible crimes, is that\nnot only is it potentially insightful because they might give you\na real answer and not just a controlled narrative about why they\ncommitted these crimes. If they are either maintaining their innocence or\nthey're more reluctant to do that, I think even the narrative that they\nare controlling, that they're being very careful with, still\ntells us a lot about them. So, I think, certainly in my research\non environmental crime as well, what we see is that people use a lot of\nrationalization. They say things like, \"Well, everybody's doing it,\" and, \"If I hadn't done\nthis first, somebody else would have done this waste crime or this other\nkind of crime.\" So there's this rationalization. There's this\nnormalization. There's this diminishing of your own\nrole and agency, and that still tells us a lot about the\npsychology of people who commit crimes, because most of us are very bad at saying sorry and saying, \"I messed\nthis up, and I shouldn't have done that.\" And instead, what our brains do is\nthey try to make us feel better, and they go, \"No, you're still a good person\ndespite this one thing.\" And so, we try to rationalize it, we try to excuse it, we\ntry to explain it. And there is some truth to it as well, because we know the reasons why we\nengage in that behavior and other people don't have the whole context. So,\nwe also do have more of the whole story. But on the other hand, we need\nto also face the fact that sometimes we do terrible things, and we need to stop\ndoing those terrible things and prevent other people from doing the same. - I find these pictures of World\nWar II leaders as children kind of fascinating, because it\ngrounds you. It makes you realize that there is a whole story there of\nenvironment, of development through their childhood, through their teenage years.\nYou just remember they're all kids. Except Stalin. He was looking\nevil already when young. - Well, people used to not smile in photos as well.\nSo looking at historical photos of children, or sometimes even kids in other cultures,\nit's like, \"Oh, why are they all so serious?\" But our creepiness radars are also way off. This is\nsomething that I've been interested in for a long time as well, is that we have this\nintuitive perception of whether or not somebody is trustworthy. And that\nintuitive perception, according to ample studies at this point, is not\nto be trusted. And one thing in particular is whether or not we think\nsomeone is creepy, including children, but usually the research is done, of\ncourse, on adult faces and with adults. And only recently did\nwe even really define what that vague feeling of creepiness is. It has a lot to do with not following\nsocial norms. This is something we see that transfers to other\ncontexts, like why people are afraid of people with severe mental illness\nand psychosis. If you're on the bus or the Tube in London, and\nsomeone's talking to themselves and they're acting in an erratic way, we know that people\nare more likely to keep a distance. There There was one study where they literally\nhad a waiting room where they also had people with chairs, and the question\nwas, \"How many chairs would you sit away from someone you know has a severe mental\nillness?\" And the answer is you sit more chairs away, and there's a physical and\npsychological distancing that's happening there. And it's not\nbecause people with severe mental illness are inherently more violent\nor more dangerous. That is not actually what the research finds.\nIt's that we perceive them as such because we perceive them as weird basically. We go, \"This isn't how\nyou're supposed to be behaving, and so I'm worried about this and so I'm\ngoing to keep my distance.\" And so creepiness is much the same, and\nthat's where you can totally misfire whom you perceive as creepy just because\nthey're not acting in the way that you expect people to act in society. - Well, what are the sort of concrete\nfeatures that contribute to our creepiness metric? Is that meme accurate that\nwhen the person's attractive, you're less likely to label them as creepy? - It depends. If they're too\nattractive, it can be. So there's- There's, there's effects\nthat interact there. - That's hilarious. - And we also don't trust people\npotentially who are too attractive. But again, deviation from\nthe norm. And so if you're deviating in any way, that can lead to well, your assessment being more wrong,\nbut also you assessing people as more negative. And so with creepiness, the main thing that bothers me\nas a criminal psychologist is that tangential to creepiness is\nthis general idea of trustworthiness and that you can tell whether somebody is\nlying. And I've done research on this, as have lots of other people, like Aldert\nVrij is one of the leading researchers on deception detection.\nAnd he has found in so many studies that it's really\nhard to detect whether someone is lying reliably, and that\npeople, especially police officers, people who do investigative\ninterviewing, they have this high confidence level that they,\nbecause of their vast experience, can in fact tell whether the person across\nfrom them is lying to them, this witness, the suspect. And the answer is that,\neven that, if you take them into experimental settings, they are no\nbetter than chance at detecting lies, and yet they think they are.\nAnd so again, you get into this path where you're going to miss people who are\nactually lying to you potentially, and you're going to potentially point at innocent\npeople and say, \"I think you're guilty of this crime,\" and you go hard on that person in\na way that might even lead to a wrongful conviction. - So it's the fact that it's very\ndifficult to detect lies and overconfidence in policing\ncreates a huge problem. - Not just policing, in relationships\nand in lots of other contexts as well. I mean, a lot of jealousy is born out of\nuncertainty. Jealousy isn't, \"I know for sure that you have done something that is threatening\nour relationship.\" A lot of jealousy is, \"What's in my head because I am assuming that\nyou might be thinking or doing X.\" And that is also\nbasically an exercise in lie detection. And there as\nwell, we are very bad at it. - Is there a combination of the dark tetrad\nand how good you are at lying? Like, are people with certain traits, maybe\npsychopathy, are better at lying than others? - There's definitely some research to support the idea\nthat people with psychopathy are better at lying. There's also some research\nspecifically on sort of faking good in, for example, parole\ndecisions. So when it comes up to someone who is... There's a legal\ndecision to be made as to whether this person can be released from prison or\nreleased from just detention in general. And then the person will act\nin a particular way, sort of mimic a good prisoner, mimic\nsomeone who's safe to be released into society. And then the committee\ngoes, \"Oh, well, you know, this, this person's doing great,\" and so they're ready\nto be released. And then they make the wrong decision because that person has been faking\nit. So I think with psychopathy, it's a bit complicated. There has been some sort of, historically as well,\nsome concern that certain treatment for psychopathy, especially empathy-focused\ntreatment, makes people with psychopathy more likely\nto fake empathy and to weaponize it. But then there's other\nresearch which finds that if you use other kinds of interventions,\nso like Jennifer Skeem in California who does research on\npeople with psychopathy who have committed severe crimes. And she specifically\ncreates these treatment programs that aren't just around empathy, but they're more\naround almost learning the rules of society and convincing people that actually\nbeing pro-social is a better way to get what you want in life. And\nso there's a real need for tailored treatments to deal\nwith especially certain kinds of personality traits, dark personality\ntraits, to try and convince people basically, actually being pro-social\nis the better path, rather than just going hard on, you know, empathy\nand things that they don't maybe also see as faults with themselves. - Is there a psychological\ncost to empathizing with... - so-called monsters? You\nreferenced Nietzsche in the book, you know, \"Gaze into the\nabyss, the abyss gazes into you.\" If you study, quote unquote, \"evil\" or study monsters\nthat you may become that. Is there a danger of that? I don't\nthink so. I think that's what people fear. So, a lot of the Nietzsche\nquotes I use as well are... Some of them I like because they speak to the chapters I write\nabout, but... and the issues I write about. But some of them I also like because\nthey are how people think about evil and people who are labeled evil. And I do think with gazing into the\nabyss and the abyss gazing back, it's more of a... You're\ntrying to find it. And that's why in some ways that doesn't\nwork actually, because it isn't a total blank. It isn't the abyss. There are\nin fact things that you can see, even, even if it's just superficially,\nand patterns you can recognize to help you and key decision-makers, especially\nin legal settings, make better decisions around people like this. So, when\nthey see these patterns, they act a better way. So yeah, I get asked a lot as a criminal psychologist, \"Do you\ncarry the cases that you deal around with you?\" So, some of the\ncases involve, you know, huge amounts of witnesses, huge amounts of potential\nvictims, and so in these cases there are very visceral victims, and so in these\ncases there are very visceral descriptions sometimes\nof heinous crimes. And I think that as someone\nwho does this work, you can't be someone who sees it as\nanything other than a puzzle. So, you have to look at it and go, \"Here's the\ndifferent pieces of information. What I am doing is pattern recognition.\nI'm not here to emotionally invest in each of these victims or potential\nvictims. That's not my role. There's therapists for that. There's other people who do that work.\nI am here working with the police. I'm here working with lawyers. I'm here\nlooking at it more objectively to see how this all fits together.\"\nAnd so, I think that's how I engage with it. I see it as this puzzle\nthat I'm trying to figure out. I worry for my own brain that\nwhen I confront people and see them as a puzzle, which\nI do. I see the beauty in the puzzle. All the puzzles\nlook beautiful to me. I'm sometimes like a Prince\nMyshkin character from The Idiot by Dostoevsky, where you just\nsee... It's not the good in people, but the beauty\nin the puzzle. And I think you can lose your footing\non the moral landscape if you see the beauty in\neverything a bit too much. Because, everyone is interesting. Everyone is complicated. It's the\nclassic scientist response as well to what other people in society\ngo, \"Ooh.\" They go, you know, \"This is horrible,\" or, \"This atrocious thing\nhas happened,\" or, \"This shocking, existential crisis inducing\nthing I've just found is, you know, giving me existential crisis.\"\nAnd scientists instead go, \"Oh, wow!\" And you can sort of see the\ndelight in discovery as well. And I think sometimes scientists\nread as callous because we enjoy this discovery of knowledge\nand the discovery of insights. And it just feels like this little light\nbulb has gone off and you go, \"Oh, I understand a tiny bit more about the human experience\nor about the world around us.\" And I think it must be similar. I don't know\nthat I feel or worry that I sort of become more, quote unquote,\n\"evil.\" I think it's more that you add this nuance, which I guess sometimes can be estranging to other\npeople. So, there's that. When you speak with others, sometimes, like even when I say, \"We\nshouldn't use the word evil,\" people go, \"No, but you have to. Does that mean you're\ntrivializing things?\" The answer is no, I'm not trivializing. I'm just trying to\nunderstand. Also, sympathizing or being empathetic towards people whom\nothers have written off is always going to get that response from some people. I mean,\nthere are real questions around whom we're platforming and what that has and what\nrole we have as content creators, both of us, of the people we\ntalk about, how we cover them. I often come across this in true crime\nwork that I do, because I get asked to do TV shows. I host TV\nshows, and I host BBC podcasts. And there's always the question\nof sometimes people commit murder to become famous.\nAnd should it be a blanket ban that we don't cover those cases,\nor should we cover those cases but in a different way, or should we anonymize\nthe… So, it doesn't mean that you should never cover that case. It just\nmeans that you need to think about it. Speaking of which, you've done a\nlot of really great podcast shows. One of them is Bad People\nPodcast. You co-host it. It has over 100 episodes, each covering a crime. What's maybe the most disturbing\ncrime you've covered? One of the most disturbing crimes that we\ncovered on Bad People, and just to be clear, Bad People, much like the title Evil,\nis tongue in cheek, where the idea is it's people whom we refer to as bad\npeople. And then it's always a question of who are these, quote unquote, \"bad people,\"\nand are we all capable of doing these terrible things? But one of the most,\ncertainly, problematic, dark cases that we covered was\nthe Robert Pickton case. And the episodes are called Piggy's\nPalace, because that was the nickname for the farm where\nRobert Pickton brought victims whom he had kidnapped,\nand then he killed them, and he did terrible things to their\nbodies. And rumors have it, certainly, that he fed some of these\nvictims to pigs. Now, one of the reasons I covered that case is actually because it\nwas influential in my own career. So, Robert Pickton is one of the most\nfamous Canadian serial killers of all time. And as I was doing my undergrad at Simon Fraser University in Canada,\nI was being taught by someone called Stephen Hart. And Stephen Hart was\nan expert witness on the Robert Pickton trial, and so he was keeping us abreast\nof some of the developments of what he was covering. And I\nfound it so interesting, and I loved Stephen Hart as a person, and\nhe seemed to have this sense of humor, this gallows humor, around\nit all, despite being faced with one of the arguably worst\npeople in Canadian history. And I thought that that was so\ninteresting, that someone could be so nice, so kind, so\nwonderful, and be an expert witness for these kinds of people. And so that's\none of the reasons I went into the field is because of this case as well. And so we had\nhim on the show. So he came onto Bad People and we interviewed him for it. - All right. And he has done, I imagine,\na lot of really difficult cases. - Yes, he's done a lot of difficult\ncases, as have other researchers like Elizabeth Loftus, who's one of the main founders of the area of false\nmemory research, which is what I also do. I do research\non memory and false memory and witness statements.\nAnd Elizabeth Loftus has also been a recent expert for the Ghislaine\nMaxwell case. She was in the press. She was in the press, and\nso she has worked with lawyers to educate the\ncourt on memory in lots of really, really controversial cases. But\nthe way she would explain it is that it's still her role to just train people\nand teach people on how memory works. She's not there to decide whether people\nare guilty or innocent, but she is there to help people distinguish between fact and fiction\nwhen it comes to how our memories work or don't. - So what kind of person feeds\ntheir victims to pigs? What's interesting about that psychology? - The psychology about Robert Pickton? I\nmean, he was a tricky person because I think he was profoundly lonely, and this is\nsomething we see with a lot of serial killers is that they have this\nloneliness, which I think not only contributes to them committing\nthe crimes in the first place, but also allows them to get away with things\nbecause they don't have as much of a social network or any social network that is\nhelping them to do what's called reality monitoring, to understand\nwhat's true and what's not. And so when you see people get radicalized\nin their own thoughts, whether that's in the sense of things like\nschizophrenia where you've got psychosis, you've got delusions,\nmaybe command hallucinations. That's when you think you're hearing voices\nand someone is telling you that you have to do something, usually something\nharmful to other people. And if you don't follow those, you will hear those voices forever.\nThey're profoundly distressing, and they are one of the aspects of schizophrenia\nthat if you have, it does make you more prone to violence. And so for these kinds of cases, if you don't\nhave someone intervening, whether that's a family member or a\ntherapist saying, \"How can you tell whether this thought is real?\" Maybe\nthat thought, maybe you're not hearing that voice, right? Maybe that aspect of\nwhat you're thinking isn't true and bringing you back closer to\nreality. You can just wander off to whatever alternate universe\nthat you might live in in your head, and it's the same with\nradicalization in other contexts is that you see that people who drift more and\nmore into a certain group that has certain beliefs that are maybe divorced\nfrom the evidence, divorced from reality. You can see that people\nwill get more extreme over time, and unless you have a tether that\nbrings you back, that allows you to do reality monitoring, it's going to be\nvery difficult to find your way out of that. So with serial killers,\nwe find this reality monitoring problem, and I think part of that's related to\nthe lack of social networks that people have. - That's fascinating. So that's one important\ncomponent of serial killers. What else can we say about the psychology? What\nmotivates them? So if you look at some of the famous serial killers,\nTed Bundy, John Wayne Gacy, Jeffrey Dahmer, is there other\nthings we could say about their psychology that motivates them?\nSo interesting, the tether to reality. I mean, loneliness is\na part of the human condition. It is, in fact, one of its side effects\nis you can get untethered. And then with some of these brains, I guess the\nuntethered goes to some dark place. - The untethered goes to a\ndark place, and it then is often combined with some\nof these other dark tetrad traits. So you've got someone who\nmaybe is high on psychopathy, low on empathy, someone who's high\non sadism, someone who thinks that it's okay to pursue your\nown goals. And your own goal can be, like with Jeffrey Dahmer, you can be wanting to create the perfect\npartner, which in some ways seems to be what he was trying to do by killing people and\npiecing them together and sewing up a sort of new version. There's\nsomething in that where I can't help but go, \"That's so sad.\" I don't go, \"Oh my God, how awful.\" Of course\nit's atrocious. Of course it's heinous, but I have this\nreal sympathy for that, and I think that's important\nfor us to have, though. And not to say, \"I can't relate to\nthis person at all,\" but to say, \"That is an extreme manifestation\nof something I have felt, and the difference between me engaging in that and\nthis person engaging in that are these other factors.\" But the core is in all of us. - Do you think all of us are capable of evil,\nof some of the things we label as evil? - I think all of us are capable of doing basically the\nworst things we can imagine. And one of the reasons I think that is because you can see neighbors\nturning on each other, especially if you look historically at the start of wars or big political moments where you have people\nwho would have called each other friends turning each other in to\nthe police, killing each other, doing terrible things. So I think all it\ntakes is to become convinced that the people you think are your friends are actually\nyour enemies, whether that's just in your own world or in a larger political\nnational landscape that I don't think it takes all that much\nfor us to be capable of doing terrible things. But that's also why it's really\nimportant when things are good and when you're not at war and when you have the\ncapacity to think deeply about important issues, to train your mind on these thoughts of knowing that\nthings like loneliness can manifest in these extreme\nways, that things like jealousy and aggression, that they can turn\ninto murder, that they can turn into these horrible versions. And to\nthen also spot the red flags if you start going down that path.\nI think if we don't rehearse evil, if you will, we are much\nmore likely to engage in it, especially in those moments where we don't have\nmuch time or energy to really think about what we're doing. - Yeah, I really appreciate the way you\nthink and the way you talk about this. Listening to history, when I'm reading\nhistory books, I imagine myself doing the thing I'm reading\nabout, and I almost always can imagine that, like when\nI'm being honest with myself. - And it's important to admit\nthat to ourselves. And research on murder fantasies finds that most\nmen have fantasized about killing someone, about 70% in two studies. And most women as well. More than 50% of\nwomen have fantasized about killing somebody. So murder fantasies are\nincredibly common, and certainly according to some researchers,\nthat's a good thing. Being able to rehearse and think\nthrough doing the most terrible things is a great dress\nrehearsal for also how we don't want to live our lives. And\nonly if you are able to fully think through, \"What would\nI actually be like if I was engaging in this? What would I be thinking?\nWho would I be with? What would be my... the group that I'm charging against\nthis other person? You know, who am I there with?\" As you said, like\nreally putting yourself in the shoes of these people who have done\nterrible things. That is how you also realize that you do\nnot want those consequences. And so yeah, you maybe want to murder this person,\nbut you don't really want to murder this person. That's that intuitive sort of animalistic brain\ncoming in. But then luckily, we have higher reasoning that goes, actually,\nif you think this through, that's a pretty terrible consequence for yourself. So the\nbetter thing to do is not to murder this person. So I think it's\nadaptive to be able to fantasize and think about these things. Obviously,\nif you start getting to a point where you're ruminating and you're going in these\ncircles where you're constantly fantasizing about doing dark things,\nespecially to a specific person, I'd always advise seeing somebody,\nto talk to a psychologist, for example. Because that then does become\na risk factor for acting on those dark fantasies. But up to that point, if it's\njust a fleeting thought or something that in one day you had these thoughts,\nthat is totally healthy, I would say. - And also, I think it's useful to simulate\nor think through what it would take to say no in that situation. Meaning, once you're able to\nimagine yourself doing evil things, you have to imagine\nthe difficult act of resisting. A lot of people think\nthey would resist in Nazi Germany. Well, most people didn't, and\nthere's a reason for that. It's not easy. Same\nreason, I've seen this. If something bad is happening\non a public street, most people, it's the bystander effect.\nMost people just stand there and watch. I've seen it once\nin my life. Yeah, this is humans, so it's actually you\nwant to simulate stepping up. - Yeah, so it's also been called the heroic\nimagination. Someone who has studied evil, quote unquote, at length is Philip\nZimbardo. He did the Stanford Prison Experiment, and that was an experiment\nwhich is... I mean, it's now been torn apart in various ways. It\nwas absolutely influential for psychology. It's where participants\nwere randomly assigned whether they would be prisoners or guards in a\nmock prison experiment, and then for a number of days, they\nwere told to do various things. And it got out of\ncontrol, and the guards went way over what they were supposed to\nbe doing, and they effectively started pseudo-torturing some of\nthese inmates or these pretend inmates. And the whole thing had\nto be stopped prematurely, but it was really fundamental in showing how\njust by randomly being assigned into guard, the person in charge,\nor inmate, you can, within a matter of days, have a completely different\nway of thinking about one another. And so Philip Zimbardo has also\nspoken at length about evil and that all of us are capable of it in\nthe right circumstances, but he also is a big proponent of what he\ncalls the heroic imagination. And the heroic imagination is really\nwhat the purpose of everything I do is. The purpose of what I do isn't just to go, \"Ooh,\nthis is curious,\" and to stop there. The point is to then prevent it, and to prevent it\nin ourselves because that's, I think, ultimately what has to happen. You can't\ndo a top-down sort of government-level approach to trying to be so tough on\ncrime that no one will ever commit crime. That's impossible. But you can change, to say it in a tacky way, the hearts and\nminds of individuals to recognize the pathways towards evil and\nto go, \"Wait, I'm off track. I don't want to go this way, and I'm going\nto stop myself here, and here's how I can find my way back.\" And so the heroic\nimagination is exercising that. I see someone on the street.\nHow do I make sure that they're okay? How do I not become a bystander?\nAnd actually, the bystander stuff is interesting because there was a\nreally famous case, the murder of Kitty Genovese, and there\nwere all of these both ear and eyewitnesses. So an ear witness is someone who just\nhears things, and an eyewitness is someone who sees the crime happening, and they\ndidn't intervene in the murder of this woman. And so this case\nwas often taken as this almost example of, \"Look how terrible\nhuman beings are. We just walk by. We don't care about what's happening to strangers\non the streets.\" And actually, what's happened since is that there's been lots of\nother bystander experiments, and they have not substantiated this.\nSo we need to be very careful with looking at these extreme cases and going,\n\"How horrible that this happened to this one person,\" and it is. But that doesn't mean\nthat that's always how it happens. And so actually, what we find in bystander research\nis that most of the time, bystanders do intervene. It's just when there\nhas already been a crowd that has accumulated, you read the room,\nand you assume, \"Well, nobody else has intervened yet, and so\nit must not be a real problem.\" That desire to not stand out in a negative\nway is often what hinders heroism. I mean, that's why we look at heroes,\npeople who especially risk their own lives to save others,\nespecially strangers. We see them with a sort of respect that nobody else gets, and\nthat's because we recognize that we might not be capable of that. and that's because we recognize\nthat we might not be capable of that. If I saw a stranger\ndrowning in a river, would I really risk my life jumping\nin the river to maybe save them? I think that's a\nbig question mark. And so when people do that, especially when\npeople almost have this inherent reaction that they just jump in, they just\ngo for it, that is something that is a really admirable quality that we as\nhumans do celebrate, and we should. And I think often we should celebrate\nthose incidents more and not the, you know, the bystander moments\nwhere we didn't intervene. We should be normalizing intervening. - And again, this idea\nof heroic imagination, actually simulating, imagining\nyourself standing up and saving the person when a crowd is watching, they're\ndrowning, to be the one that dives in, tries to help. You mentioned 70% of men and some large percentage\nof women fantasize about murder, and I also read that you wrote that\nrecidivism for homicide is only 1 to 3%. So that raises the question,\nwhy do people commit murder? - Murder is a really interesting crime because most of the time it's\nperpetrated for reasons that we don't like as a society. So as a person\nwho talks a lot to the news and also to producers who are trying to make true\ncrime shows, who don't necessarily have a deep understanding of psychology, let's\njust say, and who come at you with myths where you go, \"Oh, no, we're not, we're not going to talk\nabout that. We're not going to talk about whether or not the mom is to blame for this person killing\nsomebody.\" I hate that. That's one of my least favorite sort of... The\ntrauma narrative of all people who do terrible things must have had a terrible\nchildhood, I think is really problematic. What really happens in murder most of the time,\nwhich is not what you see on TV because it's really boring, is it's a fight that\ngets out of control. And if you look at the real reasons stated,\nit's things like, \"This person owed me $4 and so I\nkilled him. This person stole my bike. This person\nowed me...\" It's these really stupid reasons, and it is\njust this bad decision in the moment, an overreaction to\na fight, to an argument, and it wasn't planned. It's\nnot some psychopath sharpening their knives, waiting for months to try\nand kill this person. And we don't like that because there's something called\nthe victimization gap, which is that the impact of this\nextreme situation on the perpetrator, there's a huge gap between\nthat and the impact on the victim and their family. So the victim\nloses a life, whereas the perpetrator, sure, they get imprisoned,\nbut that... At best, right? If you will, in terms of justice. But\nthey don't have the same kinds of consequences, and we don't like that.\nWe like things that have extreme consequences to have extreme reasons.\nAnd so that's why I think there's this real desire to show\nserial killers and to show people who are, in fact, planning\nmurders for a really long time and then engage in them, rather than\nthis fight that goes out of control, or someone drink\ndriving, or someone who is... I mean, unfortunately, intimate\npartner homicide is also one of those situations that is common, one of\nthe top four reasons for murder as well. But that's not the almost glamorized version that we\nsee of murder online or that we see in the news. So I think it's\nalways important to talk about murder as something that is rarely inherent to an individual. Very few people\nwant to murder. They might fantasize about it, but they don't want to go through\nwith it. And very few people who do engage in murder wanted to do it in that\ninstance, never mind again. I think in general, we have the way\nthat we look at lots of crimes upside down. So we put murderers in\nprison for a really long time because we think that that's justice,\nwhich is, sure, that's one version where it's, you know, an eye for an eye\nkind of. You know, life for life. There's obviously the more extreme version of that,\nwhich is the death penalty, which I don't adhere to, but I could see the rationalization of, well,\nyou stole somebody else's life, so you don't deserve to have one. But there's also the\nother side, which is, if we're looking at prevention, murder is really...\nLike, they're not going to... People aren't going to go out and murder\nagain. So that is... That's a really low risk in terms of recidivism, actually.\nAnd high risk are things like fraud and elder abuse and\nsexual violence. And so in some ways, sometimes our\nsanctions are upside down in terms of how we can actually make\nsociety safer, and they're in line more just with how we perceive\njustice to work. So there's, there's big fundamental questions about how we organize\nour justice systems and what we want them to be for. - Can you just linger on that a\nbit? So how should we think about everything you just described for how our criminal justice system\nforgives? If they are very unlikely to murder again, how would you\nreform the criminal justice system? - I think forgiveness is up to the victims' families, and quite often,\nwhen you speak with victims' families, there is this\ndivide where you have some who are much more keen on\nsomething called restorative justice, which is where they... what they want\nis for the person to apologize, the perpetrator to apologize,\nto explain how it happened. Also, quite often, I mean, you look at some\nof the other consequences in the other context, it's sort of, like, teenage boys\nwho are part of gangs, for example, is the other context. And it's a teenage boy\nkilling another teenage boy. These are kids, and the parents\nof a teenage boy understand that. This isn't... they don't\nthink of this other perpetrator as this grown man who has... I don't\nknow. I think we think of it as this fight between the parents\nof both teenage boys in that case, but really, often what\nparents want is to just understand how this could happen and, in some ways, to\nallow the other teenage boy to still have a life and to not steal theirs\nas well, or his as well. So there's that restorative justice model\nwhere forgiveness, I think, belongs to the families. Some families, of course, want\nthe most extreme punishment. That's also... I can understand how that would\nbe a response that's triggered if you've suffered a severe loss. But\nif we're looking to make society safer, putting people who've\nkilled in prison is not actually the answer, right?\nBecause if we want society to be safer, it should be based purely\non what is most likely to deter crime and who is most\nlikely to engage in it, and that's where I think\nwe've got it upside down. - If I could just stick to The Bad\nPeople Podcast, there's an episode on incels called Black Pill, Are\nIncels Dangerous? So are they dangerous? What's the\npsychology of incels? - So that episode was all\nabout what it means to espouse certain kinds of\nviews, especially about women, and what it means to be\nin an environment that is fueling the fire of... well, hatred of gender. And so, and the idea\nof entitlement. So I think one thing that we see often in\ncrimes, of all sorts actually, is this sense of entitlement that\ndrives the perception that I'm allowed to engage in X because of something\nelse. And I deserve to have a life that looks like this, but I don't, and so I'm\ngoing to go take it, or I'm going to go do something to show my dissatisfaction\nin life. And so if you think that all men deserve to have a happy\nlife, sort of a Disney version with a woman at home who's taking care\nof the kids, and it's the sort of white picket fence ideal that we've been sold. We\nhave been told that that is what we should have. Like, I understand\nwhere it comes from, and the question though, is, are we\nentitled to that or is that the idea that that's something we should strive towards?\nAnd I think the answer is no, nobody's entitled to a good life. I\nwould like to see freedoms and rights manifest in such a way\nthat everyone is able to achieve the kind of life that they\nthemselves want. But you're not entitled to it. And so that's where I think\nit can get a bit crossed and we can be sold these lies that are\nbasically impossible for everybody in society to\nachieve. And understandably people get angry, and if you're angry and\nif you feel entitled and if you're in this group where everyone else is thinking\nthe same way as you, yeah, that can make you dangerous. - And the internet gives you a\nmechanism to be your worst self. - And it can reinforce that worst self. You\nsee other people saying, \"Yeah, I feel the same way. Do you want me to help you?\" - Oh, the internet. So, one more episode, you interviewed\nthe lady Cecilia, who got Tinder swindled. Can you tell what happened\nwith the Tinder swindle situation? - So, the Tinder Swindler, that\nwas a person who pretended on Tinder to be a rich\nguy who had this lavish lifestyle, and he would\nmatch with women on Tinder, and very quickly\nlove-bomb them. So he would send them all kinds of messages\nand immediately start being very emotional, very\nsharing, pretend that he's messaging from his private jet, or actually\nmessage from his private jet, but pretend that he's in love with this\nperson very quickly. And then he would invite women, in this case Cecilia,\nto very expensive, luxurious dates. So he would whisk them away to\nParis, or he would show them his private jet, or he would take them to a\nreally expensive restaurant, almost to prove that he, in fact, is this really wealthy guy. And he would simultaneously\nbe building up the story of a future together. You\nsee this in people who are really problematic in relationships in\na lot of ways. I mean, this is not just in scams or in criminal settings,\nbut problematic relationship styles often involve someone\nwho is creating this idea of a future together that you\ncan just see it now. You know, \"Our kids in the garden running\naround. You're the only one for me.\" That kind of language, like almost\nplanning your wedding on the third date. That kind of thing is what\nhe would weaponize. And she, Cecilia, was looking for\nlove. She wanted all of those things, and so it worked really\nwell. He ended up doing is defrauding her of lots of\nmoney, and she ended up taking out loans, and her family were\ngiving her money to help what he was saying was this critical\nsituation. Very classic fraud. It's a critical situation where he was\nbeing followed, he was under attack, and he needed her to pay for some things. He\nneeded her to pay for some flights, until she ran out of money.\nAnd then she realized that this all was a big fraud.\nThis was a love scam. So, the reason that we spoke\nwith her is partly to show how it can happen, and I think\nit's really important to remind people that this is something\neverybody is capable of believing. Fraud works because people know what we want to hear, and they\ntell us the things we want to hear. And so, I think all of us, there's a tailored\nversion of fraud that could appeal to basically everybody if they have\nenough information about you. - Yeah, and by the way now, in modern\nday, AI could probably better and better do that kind of\nthing. Do the tailored version of the story that\nyou want to believe, and love is a topic on which that\nwould be especially effective. - Yeah, because you're playing with people's emotions,\nand you know that they're vulnerable in that way. And most people want to\nbe loved and want to love, and so it's a really manipulative way in, and I think it's really horrible,\nbut it's also something that we all almost underestimate. So we think,\n\"I would identify fraud. I would know if someone was trying to scam me of money,\"\nuntil it happens to us, and then we go, \"Oh, wait. That did just happen.\" And\nthen we get really embarrassed. And so I think talking about it is really\nimportant, and seeing it as not this thing that happens to dumb people, because that is\nsometimes how it's framed. It's like, \"Oh, such an idiot.\" \"She was so gullible.\" Was she? Or was she just a nice person\nwho wanted to believe that this person was capable of loving her,\nwhich I would hope we all are. - Yeah, and I hope she and others that\nfall victim to that kind of thing don't become cynical and keep trying. - Yeah. Yeah, that's right, that's right. - Those kinds of things\ncan really destroy your ability to be vulnerable to the world.\nBut, I mean, it sounds like this same kind of thing is just commonplace in all\nkinds of relationships. That's the puzzle that it could be a... If you\nfind yourself inside of a toxic relationship with a, quote, \"Love\nbombing,\" It could be a lot of manipulative, fraud type of things,\nright, inside a relationship. ...in this spectrum. - Well, and coercive control is becoming more\nof an issue, where that's when somebody, for example, in a relationship takes\ncontrol of the finances, and that's often a man in a relationship. That's\nsort of traditionally because it falls often along these gender\nlines. But the problem is if that person then starts to weaponize the fact\nthat they're controlling the finances and starts using words like, \"I'm going\nto give you your allowance,\" instead of going, \"You've paid as much into this\nas I have, and so this is our shared money,\" and starts using that\nand controlling things and controlling how the other person lives\nin that relationship, that's when you get into things that are called\ncoercive control. And things like jealousy can also be used in that way. - Is there any way out of\nthat? Maybe the jealousy study, or is this a vicious downward\nspiral whenever there's any kind of signs like this that means you're screwed, get out? Or is this\njust the puzzle of the human condition and humans getting together\nand having to solve that puzzle? - I have non-traditional views on\njealousy. I'm not a jealousy researcher, but I have done some\nresearch on sexuality and I personally think that jealousy\nis basically always a red flag. Because what it means is that\nthe person who is jealous isn't secure in the relationship, and the reason\nthat they're not secure in the relationship is either because the relationship is wrong\nfor them or because they are insecure in themselves. And I don't think it is a\nsign of love. I don't think it is a sign of, you know, you want to protect your mate.\nI think it is mostly control, and it's the desire to control and to possess.\nAnd jealousy, we know, is a precursor to intimate partner violence almost\nalways. As in, not all jealousy leads to violence, of course, but all violence\nis the jealousy as a precursor. And quite a lot of that is imagined things\nthat the partner is doing, not even based on reality. Then we go back to\nour deception detection research, where we're bad at telling whether\nsomeone's lying or not. And so if you're basing how you're interacting with that\nperson on a faulty lie detector, you're going to make bad decisions. So,\nthe research also bears out that most people are really bad at monogamy. So, most people either have cheated on a\nsignificant other, maybe not their current significant other, but a significant\nother or have cheated multiple times, and that's just consistently\nfound in the research. - So, maybe there's\njustification to be jealous? - I think it's the other way around. I\nthink monogamy is setting us up to fail. So, I think monogamy is a social\nconstruct. That's a nice idea for some people, and I think that at least based\non the research on how people actually behave, they're not actually behaving in a\nmonogamous way. If you're cheating on your partner, that is not monogamy. That\nis polyamory, potentially. So, the love of multiple people. And it's lying,\nand it's... It doesn't have to be that way. So, I'm polyamorous, and\nI believe that you can love multiple people. I don't know that everyone is always going\nto meet lots of people at the same time that they're going to love. But I think that\nthere's been a move towards more people embracing open relationships and\nnon-traditional relationship structures, and I think that is healthy\nto at least have as an option. I think the idea that\nthere's just one size fits all for relationships is really harmful\nto a lot of people, and it just doesn't really work for everybody. - Well, if you could just focus in on one\ncomponent, it seems to me one of the problems is honesty as a hard\nrequirement and good communication is another hard requirement,\nbecause that feels like the prerequisites for\navoiding all these problems. - And I guess with jealousy, what I'm\nthinking of is actually not an instance of jealousy, - Oh, yeah - ...so where you have a feeling of,\n\"I feel left out,\" or, \"I feel-\" It's more that sort of persistent\nfeeling of, \"I am a jealous person.\" And that's where I would say that is\nusually a red flag. And you're right. It might... It's a red flag partly because it means\nthe person's probably bad at communicating, or you are as a couple. It's not\nnecessarily just the jealous- - Together - ...person's fault. It's just that there's something\nhappening in this dynamic that is bad psychologically, and that should\nbe addressed, or maybe it's not the right relationship. - So, the fact that a lot of people\ncheat, does that mean every single person that cheated? Does\nthat mean they're probably not going to be good at monogamy? I\nguess if you can just analyze all of human civilization as it\nstands and give advice that's definitively true for everyone. Not- - That's exactly what psychologists\ndo all the time. Yeah. - Okay. Generalize. - We make sweeping statements. - This is great. No, I think it's really\ninteresting because I see all those things as romantic, choosing not to cheat,\nchoosing to dedicate yourself fully to another person. I mean, it's\nall just romantic, and then some people do cheat, and your heart is\nbroken. You write a song about it, and then you move on. You try to\nrepair yourself and be vulnerable to another human being and all that. - But why deny yourself the beautiful spectrum\nof human experience? It's like eating one meal for the rest of your life. Like,\nwhy? You don't have to do that. You could just... You can have lots of\nbeautiful people around and... - Well, for me, actually, focusing\non a single thing, you get to explore. You mentioned puzzle. Over time, you get to see the nuance,\nlike the beauty of the puzzle. You realize it's an infinitely long project\nto really understand another human being. And so, if you focus, you don't get distracted. So, that\napplies. I'm a person when I find a meal I really like, I'll stick\nto it for a long time. I'm definitely a monogamy person, I think. But that\nalso could be a component of where I grew up. You know, there's a certain\ncultural upbringing, and maybe my brain is not allowing... - ...myself certain possibilities,\nyou know? I think it's more that I want people to feel like\nthey have a choice, and that's the important thing. And I think all we see is\nmonogamy everywhere, all the time, and it's just one version of how we can live our lives, and\nI think it's not the only. And I think that having conversations with your partner as well,\nespecially early. It's harder to bring this up later on, but to have it early and say, you know,\n\"How do you actually want to structure your life?\" And I think, \"How do you want to\nrestructure your relationship?\" is part of that. And especially if you're going to commit\nyourself to one person, one primary person, or one exclusive person,\nthat's part of it. And I think then you also, you know, don't have\nto lie to each other if you do cheat. Or you can talk about it in a different\nway if you feel like there's, you know, certain capacity to be honest\nabout whom you're attracted to and how that might impact\nyour life more generally. - So, how difficult is polyamory? I think a lot\nof people would be curious about that kind of stuff. Does jealousy come up?\nIs it difficult to navigate? - It can be. I mean, all relationships\ncan be difficult to navigate. - Sure. - I think it's the same. And the same respect,\nso if you're going in because you're trying to fix something about yourself,\nyou're going to have a hard time. - Hmm. - Much like if you're dating a single person. If you're\ntrying to fix something, and this is going to be the solution to the thing that you feel is\nbroken about yourself, it's going to be hard. But if you're going in, coming\nfrom a good place, and you're going, you know, \"I want to be open, and I want\nto connect with people, and I want to love people or a person,\" then you're\ngoing to have a better time. - What's the perfect polyamorous\nrelationship look like? Can you really love multiple people deeply? - I think so. You can love people in different ways.\nAlso, you can love lots of people deeply, I think. And I think, again, it's... So,\nresearch on bisexuality, so I'm bi, has also found that people\nwho are bi are more likely to be in non-traditional relationships. And one of the reasons for that is probably also\nbecause we constantly get asked to justify our sexuality as well. And so if\nconstantly you're being asked if one person's enough for you, if one gender's enough\nfor you if you're in a relationship with one person, for example, you know, if I'm in\na relationship with a man, do you miss women? And it's like, I don't ask you that\nif you're in a relationship with a woman. Do you miss women? Like, you\nprobably do. But that's just other women than your partner. It has\nnothing to do with being bi. And so I think there's this constant barrage of questions of what\ndoes it mean? Is it real? How do you choose? What does a relationship look\nlike? Do you constantly want threesomes? There's this constant\nhypersexualization also, especially of women that we find in the research that\ncan also lead to really negative outcomes for mental health and for things like\nrisk of sexual violence. But on the other hand, you've got bisexual people themselves\nsaying, \"Yeah, but I feel like I also have this superpower that I can\nlove more widely, and gender doesn't really matter in terms of whom I'm\ncapable of loving.\" And so relationship structures almost come with that\nconversation. It's not that we need to be non-monogamous or that we\nneed to be in these kinds of relationships. It's more that I think if you've engaged\nso deeply with your sexuality partly 'cause society's forced you to, then you're\nalso going to be thinking about relationship structures more generally and going,\n\"Actually, I'm going to choose this one.\" - Yeah, that's interesting. I mean,\nyour sexual preferences and relationship structure preferences. Some of the choice has to do with how society's\ngoing to respond to it. So if you have to explain it every time you go to a\nparty, you might maybe not want to do that or talk about it or at\nleast be open about it. Yeah, I'm sure there's a lot of annoying\nconversations you have to do if you're polyamorous. Like, some of which you've\nmentioned. And yes, there are effects of like over-sexualizing the\npeople involved. Yeah. - Or thinking they're lying. So with men... I\nwrote a book called Bi: The Hidden Culture, History, and Science of Bisexuality,\nand I did that after I created a bisexual research group. So, I wasn't\na sexuality researcher, but as a bi person and a scientist, I was interested\nin the science of bisexuality, and I couldn't really find it. It\nwas really hard to figure out what people were actually learning\nabout bisexual people in comparison to other kinds of queer people. And one of the things I found is that the\nterms that are used are not necessarily bi. And so it could be things like\nplurisexual. So, if you type into Google Scholar the word bisexual, you're going to\nget a lot of confusing things also because bisexual is used for, like, two sexes where\nyou have multiple sex or you can change, and so they're bisexual. - Right. - Yeah, which is different\nentirely. And so I think partly out of that, researchers started\nusing words like plurisexual, and omnisexual is another one. And so if you're\nlooking for research on this, plurisexual is probably the word. But - What does omnisexual mean? - It's just the same. It's just another- - Okay. Got it. - another word where it's all.\nSometimes pansexual is also used. And again, the idea\nbeing that it's all genders. - So how should we think about\nbisexuality? Is it fluid, like day to day, month to month, year\nto year fluid who you're attracted to? Or is it at the same time have\nthe capacity to be attracted to anyone or attracted to everyone? What's\nthe right way to think about it? - I think the right way to think about it is\nthat I'm not attracted to most people, but I can be attracted to people regardless\nof gender, much like you're probably not probably not attracted to most people,\nbut you are attracted to people of a certain gender, maybe. And so that's...\nIt's the same as being heterosexual in terms of potentially my pool of people\nwhom I might be interested in. It's just that the gender is irrelevant. - What's the biggest thing that people\nmisunderstand about bisexuality? - The biggest thing that researchers\nfind people misunderstand about bisexuality is that it's a\nphase and that it's this idea that it's transient, that it's\nalways changing, and that it's a stepping stone. So, I think a lot\nof people still see bisexuality as on the way to Gay Town,\nsort of like you're, you're on your way, but you haven't\nquite committed and you're still stuck in expectations of society. You haven't\nquite let go yet, but really you're gay. And that's especially true for\nmen. So when you look at research on bisexual men, which is actually\nhow the research started. So, I think now when we think of bisexuality,\nwe think of women. And it's true that today twice as many women\nidentify as bisexual as men. But if you look at the history\nof this and the research on bisexuality over time, it was the other\nway around. So someone called Alfred Kinsey was one of the first\nsexuality researchers in recent history certainly, and he, after\nWorld War II, did this really big study of Sexual Behavior in the\nHuman Male, it was called. He was a biologist himself, so he thought of\ntaxonomies, and he was doing research on gall wasps, so insects.\nAnd this idea of human sexuality was sort of thrown\nat him after the war because there's also this whole move to get people to, well, reproduce and to rebuild\nAmerica. So sexuality was partly, and sex, specifically, was becoming more of an\narea of interest, both in terms of research and in terms of policy\nand funding. So Alfred Kinsey was asked, \"Do you want to do a class on human sexual behavior?\" And he was like, \"I know\nnothing about this.\" So he spent about a year just listening to students'\nquestions about what they want to know about sex, and he realized that he was looking for research to try\nand build up this course that he was probably going to teach, and he realized\nthat he couldn't answer most of their questions because the research hadn't\nbeen done. So a lot of the questions were around, \"What is normal?\" You know, \"If I feel this during sex, is\nthat normal? How often do people have sex? Should I want these? What about these\nfantasies? What does it mean? What if I have homosexual fantasies? What if I engage in this\nkind of...\" And so he was looking at all of these questions and collating them,\nand then he went out and did these huge studies, and he interviewed\nthousands of people himself, but also had all these research assistants\nwho were out there interviewing people in America about their sexual behavior, which, I mean, just picture\nthe time. This is the 1940s. This is quite a conservative time. I\nmean, certainly more than we might expect now. And here's\nthis researcher asking incredibly personal questions\nabout thousands and thousands and thousands\nof people, and he ended up finding, and this is one of the\nbig findings in this book that he published called \"Sexual Behavior\nin the Human Male,\" which was a best-seller for an entire year. He sold out auditoriums. They had to\nsometimes add the room next to the room he was in because\nthere was so much desire to go to his lectures about sex\nthat they had to connect radios to other halls to give people\nenough space to sit down. He was basically a rock star. And again, I think this challenges\nthe misconception we have about sexuality, that we think of it\nas this sort of woke thing now. that the rainbow flag and all\nthis stuff is sort of this modern invention almost. But this\nis the '40s. This was happening. People were going to these talks.\nPeople were having these conversations, and he created something called the Kinsey\nScale. And so the Kinsey Scale is from zero to six, and he found\nthat it was not useful to apply a binary to people's\nsexual desires and sexual orientation. It was more useful to\nput them on a continuum because most people were not exclusively\nhomosexual or exclusively heterosexual. Most people were\nsomewhere in between. And so zero was exclusively heterosexual\ntendencies, and six was exclusively homosexual, and he would place\npeople based on all of the things they told him somewhere on the scale,\nand about half of men were somewhere in the middle, not exclusively\neither, and about a quarter of women. Now, think about the time. - It was a very conservative time. - Well, and it's post-war though, so\nI think that mattered as well. So there's something called a homosocial\nenvironment, which has nothing to do with being gay. That has to do with being in a\nsituation where you are with people of the same gender as you. So a\nhomosocial environment are things like prisons, where you only have\nmen or only have women, war, which, at that\npoint, they just had. And so you have a lot of men who are exclusively\nin the company of men, and maybe looking around going, \"Well, now that my options\nare different, maybe I'm going to choose from this pool.\" Anyway, so he found that it was that way around, that a lot\nof people have these fantasies or actions that they've engaged in. And then there\nare other researchers, other male researchers, who found similar things, and then at\nsome point in the '70s, it swapped, and it felt like maybe more people,\nmore men were identifying as gay, and there were maybe fewer people who\nwould have called themselves bi, and suddenly this became a thing more for women.\nSo I think that there's some social things going on. There's some research things\ngoing on that actually bi men are have been studied for a long time as well. - Okay, so you said a lot of interesting\nthings. So there is a difference between the truth and the socially\nacknowledged thing. So there's social elements. I don't\nknow, this might be anecdotal, but I know a few women, friends of mine, who identify as\nbisexual. I don't know a single guy friend who identifies as\nbisexual. They're either gay or straight. So there's still\na social thing going on. - Definitely. - Right? - Definitely, and I think that\nresearch consistently shows that bisexual men are more likely to\nidentify as, well, as gay or straight. And gay, well, it depends. So if they have what we might refer to\nas a homosexual lifestyle, so they engage in sort of\ngoing to queer parties, maybe go on Grindr or other gay\napps, that would be much more a lifestyle thing, where you've embraced and\nyou see this as part of your identity, that you are part of this queer community.\nIt's much easier to say you're gay than bi, most often, also because there's\nqueerphobia within the queer community. And so you might get gay men saying\nto a bi man, \"Oh, come on, you're... \"I was bi once.\" That's a\nclassic. \"I was bi once,\" or \"Come on, you're actually gay.\" It's the same\nthat you get the other way around with bi women, is that because it's\nseen as performative, the idea being that bisexual women\nare doing it for attention, but the attention of men, specifically, that,\nwell, they're all going to go back to men anyway and they're just doing it. It's a phase.\nIt's this thing that they're doing actually to be sexy to men, not because they're\nactually interested in women. And so there's this lesbian-bi thing\ngoing on, which is often quite hostile. Not always, but often.\nAnd there's this gay male bi thing going on, which is different in\nnature but is also potentially hostile. So in both, saying you're bi can be\nproblematic, but for men more so. - Do you like the Kinsey Scale as\na sort of very simple reduction to... that there's a spectrum?\nI also saw the Klein Sexual Orientation Grid that\nadds a few parameters like who you're attracted to, how you're\nactually behaving, the fantasies you have, social preference, lifestyle\npreferences, all that kind of stuff. Self-identification, what you actually say\npublicly. All those different dimensions. Or is the Kinsey Scale a pretty\ndamn good approximation? - The Kinsey Scale's a good start.\nAnd the Klein Grid, I think, is much more fun in some ways. So the Klein\nGrid came out of research by Alfred Kinsey and others like Havelock Ellis,\nbut we won't get into him. And Fritz Klein was a male researcher doing\nresearch also on sexuality. He was specifically a therapist, and he\nwas looking at people who were struggling with their sexuality.\nAnd so people would show up in the 70s and 80s in his practice, and they\nwould say, \"I'm struggling with my sexuality.\" And he would say, \"How can I help\nyou?\" And they would say things like, \"I wish I wasn't interested in men,\nand I'm a man.\" And he would then work through what that means.\nDoes that mean you don't want to have these feelings? Does that mean that you\ndon't want to have these attractions? Does that mean that the implications of how\nyour friends and family will see you that's the problem? And so he created\nthis much more complex scale, which I think is really interesting\nfor everybody to do, no matter what their sexuality is. Because what\nit is is it gets you to think about things like, yeah,\nyour sexual identity, easy. Not just that, but in past, present, and ideal. And so if you say, \"Well,\nI used to identify as straight. Now I identify as bisexual.\" And then I have\nin my head... This doesn't mean that other people think this. In my head, I have\nan ideal, which could be straight, because that's what maybe society's told us\nwe should be. But it could also be something be something else. So I've also had\nfriends who've gone, you know, past, present, straight, straight, but ideal\nbi. So you get into these interesting dynamics where sometimes people just wish\nthey were a different sexuality than they were for other reasons. And\nthen there's other things in the, in the scale that ask\nabout your lifestyle. So, for example, if you are going to parties,\nqueer parties, if you have queer friends, then you might have a homosexual\nlifestyle, even if you're straight. But then again, it's how much lifestyle would\nyou like? And so for me, that was a real moment where I was looking at that going,\n\"Wow, my lifestyle's really straight.\" \"And maybe I need to change this.\" And\nso he was using these attractions and fantasies and identities, and\nthe past, present, ideal, to help people to think through all these\ncomplicated feelings we have around our sexuality, and to\nidentify sticking points. - Yeah, that's fascinating. So maybe the\npresumption there is if everything's aligned, the fantasies, the\nideal partner, the... all those things, that's probably\nthe healthiest place to be? - Right. And so he would look\nat especially the ideal and the present. And if those were\ndifferent, so if you said, \"I wish I was bi but I'm straight,\" or \"I'm\nbi but I wish I was straight,\" or \"I'm homosexual and I wish I was straight,\"\nhe would say, \"Let's talk about that,\" and he'd try to work through it. And the\nterm he used for bisexual people who were uncomfortable in their own\nsexuality was being a troubled bisexual. And so I think\nyou can... I think any sexuality can be troubled. I think you could\nbe a troubled straight person, a troubled homosexual person, a troubled asexual\nperson. And just thinking about why and which aspects are maybe missing, I\nthink is really healthy for people to do. - Meaning there are some puzzles that you\nhaven't quite figured out, maybe you haven't been honest with yourself about your\npreferences, all that kind of stuff. - I don't really like talking about honesty\nwith yourself. I think that's a high bar. And I think it's also often\nweaponized against people, especially by men, where it's this idea of you're not\nreally being honest, you're actually gay. So I think this idea of we're not being\nhonest with our own sexuality, that's a big word. I think it's more that maybe you\nhaven't had the right framework or the right words to think about aspects of\nyour sexuality that are troubling to you. - How obvious... When a person is\nbisexual, how obvious is it to identify the sexual orientation grid? Like\nhow big is the sign, whatever you are? - I think the sign is smaller than\nwe think it is. I think that there are... There's this tendency to assume\nthat sexuality is something that we find, and keep, and consolidate from our teenage years, maybe early 20s.\nYou maybe get university thrown in, sort of if you get your\nexperimental year as an undergrad. But you kind of have to choose. And that is a difficult requirement, I\nthink, for a lot of people, because you can't possibly know\nall of the things and all the people you might be interested in at\nthat point. And we change in every other way. Why wouldn't we change in this\nway? So I think giving ourselves also the ability to reappraise\nwhere we're at with our own sexuality, our own desires, our own\nrelationship status, all these things, is important to keep us\nhappy and healthy and to not run into issues that we\nknow are faced by a lot of homosexual but also bisexual people.\nResearch has found that bisexual people are more likely to self-harm. They're more\nlikely to be the victims of sexual violence, more likely to be isolated,\nmore likely to be stalked. There's lots of\ndifferent aspects of being bi that are negative. The reason for that\nis mostly because bi people are least likely to be plugged into the\ncommunity. So when you're going through stuff like this, and you feel different, and\nyou're constantly being asked about your sexuality, if you're open about it, or you're\nhiding it, that's also troubling. You're going to have these negative consequences,\nespecially if you don't feel like the queer community is really a place for you. So that's where\nalso finding your people really matters. - Since we're on the topic of sexuality,\none of the things you touched on in your book on evil was kinks, sexual fantasies. I think the\npoint of describing that was that we often label that as evil or bad. What can you say about what\nyou've learned from kinks and sexual fantasies from writing that book? - So the reason I included\nkinks and evil and sexual conversations in\ngeneral is because it is so often thrown into the same\nconversation. So if someone comes to me and says, \"Julia, I want\nyou to help me explain why this person killed this\nother person.\" And they'll often say, \"Did you know that he or she was\nalso into,\" insert kink here, or, insert nontraditional relationship\nstructure here, or insert whatever. And I respond to that\nby going, \"Okay, so?\" And I think people use these\nwords like, \"Oh, he was really into BDSM,\" and think that\nthat's going to have this really important impact on me. Or,\n\"Ooh, they were swingers.\" And so, and again, I go, \"Yeah?\" That's you know, almost like, \"And in\nother news, they were swingers.\" It's like that is not related to\nthis crime at all, unless, you know, one of the partners was killed.\nBut people see this as a defect of character, and kink is very\nmuch seen as a defect of character in many circles, especially\nin sort of broader society. And that is wild to me\nbecause if you look at research on sexual fantasies\nand kinks, a lot of people have at least\none. So a lot of people, BDSM being the most common, are\nengaging in or interested in BDSM. So things like\nchoking or things like restraints or being degraded\nor doing the degrading of other people in bed, consensually of course,\nthat is something that a lot of people fantasize about and a lot of\npeople engage in. And so these kinks and these fetishes, they\nare much more commonplace than we sometimes think about them as. Now, on the\nother hand, we obviously need to be careful not to assume that because in\npornography BDSM is almost ubiquitous, it feels, that that\nmeans everybody wants this. That is absolutely not the case, but we also\ndon't want to marginalize it and say it's almost nobody. It's somewhere in\nbetween, and the main thing is always just to ask and to have open conversations about\nwhat it is that people actually want in bed and to make sure you have things like\nsafe words, so, you know, putting in the restraints to make sure that these\ninteractions are safe and consensual and then being able to\nexplore. And, I mean, there's everything from, you know, pup\nplay where you dress up as a puppy and you engage in either\njust general frolicking or sexual behavior to other things\nlike blood play, which is when you pierce the skin to release some sort of\nblood. That can be scratching. That can be cutting. That can be of yourself or\nyour partner. That can be this idea of, you know, I don't know, it's this\ntaboo thing you're doing together, and it's sexy in its own way. And so\neverybody has their own versions of what they find attractive and rubbing\nup against people, you know, sort of unsuspecting, pretending\nthat someone's sleeping. There's this wide range\nof things, and I think people also feel often deeply ashamed\nabout the things that they are interested in. And I think that is also really sad\nbecause it makes it more likely that people are going to not be able to live that part of\nthemselves and also that they think there's something wrong with them. And that can\nspiral into things like, \"Am I evil? Am I bad? Am I a bad person because I\nhave these fantasies?\" And that ties in, unfortunately, with homosexuality\nand bisexuality and the way that certainly historically and in most parts\nof the world still today, these queer lives and queer identities are still\nvillainized. They're still seen as lesser, as bad, as a sign of\na defect of character. And if people see that within themselves, they're going\nto think differently about themselves, and we... Well, society is going to treat them\ndifferently. So it's all about destigmatizing. - I really liked what you wrote about, I\nguess it was in the context of BDSM or maybe sadomasochism or maybe\njust the submissive-dominant dynamic, like why that might be appealing, the disinhibition hypothesis.\nI guess this applies generally to sexual fantasies is\nif you live them out, that you could just let go of all the bullshit\nthat we, that we put up in normal society. That you could just be all in,\nfully present to the pleasure of it. - Right, and that's what research has found\non fetishes, especially on BDSM, is that the reason that people say they like it...\nI mean, it's hard to explain why you have a fantasy. But if you go into\nthe finer questions and really dig deep, you can find that people will explain a version of,\n\"Well, I can really let go, and I don't have to... If someone is telling\nme what to do, then I don't have to make any decisions, and I've\nspent all day making millions of decisions, and I don't have to in this\ncontext. And I really like that because it's freeing.\" And so that's that\ndisinhibition hypothesis is that the reason that we often go to things in the bedroom that in other contexts\nwe don't like or even find repulsive, like I don't in normal life\npotentially want to be told what to do. But maybe when you move into the bedroom,\nyou go, \"Yeah, but this is a different context, and I kind of want the reverse\nof what I want in my day-to-day life.\" And so I can also understand,\nlike, furries and that sort of completely living as\nanother species of it, even is... It's a really interesting\npsychological phenomenon of release and of letting go of social pressure. - But I think that also applies to...\nBecause you mentioned submissive, that's more straightforward to understand.\nI think that also applies to dominant, because like, yeah, you don't have to walk\non eggshells. It's the clarity of it. That was really interesting.\nHaving read that from you, that really made me think that there\nis a deep truth to that, to like being true to whatever\nthe sexual fantasy is. It's not just the fantasy itself that's\nappealing, it's the being free in some sense. - It's the being free, and the juxtaposition\nthere is that you are free because of the fiction. Like you're playacting,\nbut it's touching at something deep inside you psychologically.\nAnd so that's where it sort of feels weird, but it also makes sense.\nI mean, this is also why we like fiction, because it allows you to maybe be somebody\nelse, have someone else's thoughts in your mind for a while, and you really\nget to live as that for a bit. So I think, yeah, the truth and fiction sort\nof circle is always an interesting one. - So you've, for researching\nthe Bi book, the bisexuality book, what have you learned about\nsexuality in general, human nature, sexuality, and how it's practiced\nin terms of different communities? And I'm sure there are subcultures and\nstuff. Yeah. What have you learned? - So, the research on human sexuality,\nI think, is interesting, because we keep finding that people have these desires that they feel\nweird about, that they... Unless they have a community or an\napp that you can go to to live those fantasies, they can feel quite\ntroubling to the individual and they can make you unwell. And that's\ntrue whether it's about your sexuality, so being gay and being unable\nto live as a gay person, or if that's wanting to engage in BDSM\nand not having an outlet for that. So that can just make you unhappy.\nSo I think that the stigma there is that that unhappiness is going to lead\nto some sort of horrible manifestations of crime. I think that is mostly\nnonsense, but it's more that I'm concerned about the mental health\nconsequences for the individual who's unable to explore those sides of\nthemselves. And in research on kinks and sexuality, it's just about also making sure that we have visible\nrepresentation of certain kinds of communities. And so that's one of the\nreasons I ended up writing Bi. I came out in Evil. Making Evil is the UK title,\nEvil in the US. I came out because I was writing about all the things\nwe associate with the word evil, and homosexuality certainly\nis one of those things. - You came out as bisexual,\nby the way. Yeah. - Yeah, I came out as bisexual. And I\ncame out as bisexual in the book, and I did it specifically, and I wrote\nit this way, as well, because I was talking about the importance\nof visibility, and how it's through visibility that you realize that the\npeople around you, people you already know and love, are part of this community\nthat otherwise feels other. It feels foreign, it feels abstract,\nand maybe it feels scary. But if you realize that actually you've got gay friends or you've\ngot friends who are into certain kinds of fetishes. certain kinds of fetishes, or you've got friends\nwho are whatever sexuality aspect you're talking about, you suddenly go, \"Oh,\nit's gonna be much harder to dehumanize these people.\"\nAnd this is where all of this kind of comes for me\nfrom a really sad place is the... You could talk about Bi as this\nproject of love and how I was finding the community. I was trying to write\nsomething that would sort of bring us all together. But it's also because\nI'm constantly terrified that my rights are going to be\nstripped back. And we know that the laws around homosexual behavior and the rights around bisexual people as\nwell, they're in flux. There's no straight line of acceptance. And\njust because right now I happen to live in a time and place where I'm\nallowed to be openly bisexual and I can engage in homosexual activity, that\ndoesn't mean that that's gonna stay, not even necessarily in my\nlifetime. And so I think, much like writing Evil at a time when you're not\nat war and you're able to think really deeply about these important issues, I think we\nalso need to be thinking about things like sexuality and other issues that are important\nto us. And if we want to preserve our rights, we need to normalize these issues and make\nsure that they're visible so that people find it harder to dehumanize those\ncommunities. And so I'm always terrified that bisexual people are gonna be\nhypersexualized, dehumanized again, and that there's going to be laws against\nbasically just who I am. - Did you hear from a bunch of people\nafter Making Evil After Evil, the book, and mentioning and coming out\nin that book and then writing, the Bi book that, that are bisexual and\nmaybe what are some stories? I'm sure... 'Cause I haven't seen much material on\nit as you spoke to, so I'm sure they felt lonely without a community, right? - Yeah. A lot of people felt seen by the\nbook. So it was really beautiful, the fan mail I got and the sort of\nresponses to the book. And I got them from all over the world. And so in the book,\nI also spoke with some researchers who were stationed or doing research\nin countries where bisexual behavior specifically is\nillegal, or homosexual behavior was illegal. For a long time, bisexuality\nwas, especially in women, well, actually, homosexuality in\nwomen in general was sort of seen as... it was, it was a blind spot, 'cause\nwhat counted as sex is sex with a penis. And so women can't have sex with one\nanother. And so a lot of laws around homosexuality are specifically applying\nto men. And certainly, historically, that's the case. So we're talking\nabout like sodomy and that involves men and not women. And so if\nyou look at the evolution of laws, for a while, women were kind of... like it was\nsocially not necessarily acceptable, but they were kind of getting away with it\nlegally. But then more recently, especially, as bisexuality gets more visible as\nwell, certain countries have started writing it specifically into their\nconstitutions and so specifically into their laws that bisexual identities\nand behaviors are also seen as problematic and illegal. So again,\nthese laws change all the time. But in terms of fan mail, especially\nfrom people in countries where homosexuality and bisexuality\nare illegal or are seen as problematic, are\nsocially condemned — that was particularly important, so that those\npeople were particularly writing saying, some of them also saying, \"Can I\ntranslate this into this other language, on the DL, like on the down low? And just,\nlike, distribute this to my friends?\" I had people sending me messages\nsaying, \"I'm at X airport or in X country where this\nis, this would be considered contraband.\" Like this book, my\nbook is a banned book, fun fact. - Nice. - It was banned. I, I sold the\nrights to a foreign publisher, and right after it was sold, the laws changed and they sent\nme this really sad email saying, \"Unfortunately, we can't publish your book because it's now\nconsidered part of the, like, gay agenda, sort of promoting gay and homosexual\nlifestyles. And so we can't publish it anymore.\" But there's, I take like a little bit\nof pride in the fact that it's a banned book, but I find it really sad, obviously, as to what it means,\nbut it also makes me feel like it's more important. And that's what people\nwere writing to me about. - What advice would you give to young\npeople, or just people in general that are trying to figure out their sexuality\nor how to speak about their sexuality? - I'd say try and read widely on issues\naround sexuality. Books like mine, but also other books might help\nyou to navigate whether or not you're, you know, what labels there are\nand also whether or not those labels are good for you. I think things like the Klein grid\nare really helpful, especially for people who are more analytically minded like you and\nI. I think it gives you a construct to work with and numbers to work with, and\nthat can be really helpful to try and go almost seeing your sexuality as a mathematical\nequation. And I think that can be quite useful. And if that's how\nyou think, then look at the Klein grid and see if that helps\nyou to navigate things. - A bit of a tricky question, but what\nare the pros and cons of coming out publicly as a non-standard sexuality? From a recommendation perspective,\nwhat are some benefits and what are some challenges? - So the benefits are that you can,\nwell, live authentically. You can just be yourself. So I do feel more\nfree in who I am and who I'm able to sort of be online, for\nexample, now that I'm out. And because I came out\nafter, in my 30s, I think also it was almost a foot-in-the-door\ntechnique as well, which is a psychological technique of first coming\nin and then coming with your big ask. And so I'd already\npublished two books. I was already an established scientist. I\nthink if I tried bi first, I, A, wouldn't have been able to publish the book. It was the\nfirst mainstream book on bisexuality ever. And B, I don't think I would've\nbeen taken seriously as a scientist. And so having the\nother stuff first and then bi as sort of a side project,\nthat was acceptable. But I think the other way around wouldn't have been. - I think it was still brave. I think\nyou mentioned somewhere, maybe in an interview, that there was some\nconcern of being sexualized when you covered the topic of sexuality. - There still is, but I\nactually find that it's done the opposite most of\nthe time. So I think, as a woman, especially a young woman in the\npublic eye, you're sexualized anyway, unfortunately. And so that is and was already a huge part\nof my online experience. And actually, I think coming out\nas bi, A, you get allies who suddenly are like, \"We're on your\nside. We're going to help you fight the hypersexualization.\" And\npeople get almost more weird about it in a good way. They get a bit quiet\nabout it because they're like, \"Oh, now it's an identity thing. So maybe I\nshouldn't comment on what she's wearing.\" And it sort of,\nit almost disarmed some of the more sexualized comments. So for me,\nI have to say it was mostly a positive experience. - The incels didn't know what to do with it. - Exactly. Like, \"Ugh.\" - Just to go back to the beginning, what got\nyou interested in criminal psychology? - Well, if you look at my trajectory into academia and then through it,\nbasically what happened is I was ready to go study art. - Nice. - That's what happened. I had my portfolio\nready to go. I was going to study art at undergrad, and then my\ngrandfather intervened and was like, \"Being an artist is a really hard\nlife. Maybe you should reconsider.\" - What kind of art? Sorry\nto take that tangent. - Uh, painting. - That is wild. I would not have expected\nthat, cause you're so super analytical. - Yeah, I am, but I also really like\nsurrealism, and I really like messing with the sense of reality, which again,\nis obviously something that then wove its way into my academic work. Um... - That's cool. - But he was also right.\nI've always been very intellectual, let's just say. I skipped a couple\ngrades in school. I was part of the chess club. It was very much I was\nthe clever kid. And so, but there's also a part of me that's just like, \"But\nart is beautiful. I love making art and it can speak to so many people.\" Anyway, my grandfather\nconvinced me not to do it, and then I applied instead for psychology. Although\nat that point you just had to say social sciences. You didn't have to\nspecify, but I knew it was probably going to be psychology. And the reason for that was because my dad has paranoid\nschizophrenia. And so I think one of the reasons I'm so obsessed with\nthis idea of what is real, and that is in every way that, that... I mean that in terms of what is\nreal in terms of perceptions of right and wrong, what is real in terms\nof our own memories of the world, what is real in terms of what\nhappened in a crime, what is real in terms of perceptual abilities and\nneuroscience, what is real. I mean, I mean that in every way, and I\nthink that's because I grew up with someone who had a unique view\nof what is real in real time. And so seeing that, I think just affected me profoundly, because not only was it very\ndestabilizing in terms of my upbringing, but also it's just in your face that people quite literally are seeing and hearing\ndifferent things than you. And to not jump from that to what else are people\nperceiving differently than me, I think I think would be almost like a missed\nopportunity. And so I went to study psychology partly to understand that and what was going\non there, and then that took me down the sort of reality hole. And honestly, the\nreason I went into criminal psychology, is because I could have gone into any other, but\nthe criminal psychologists were the most fun. I feel like lots of psychologists\ntake themselves so seriously. And I just, I couldn't. I was\nlike, \"I don't, this isn't the vibe.\" And so the criminal\npsychologists, they had this gallows humor. They were doing arguably the\nmost serious of the crimes and the cases, and yet, were somehow having fun and having nice lives.\nAnd I saw myself and I went, \"Well, I want to do this\nversion.\" And so I did. - Yeah, that's great to hear, that a criminal\npsychologist, because probably they have to really, more than any other subfield,\nconfront the reality of the mind. - And it's often quite procedural.\nSo I'm also much more interested in applied sciences\nbecause I like the idea of, you know, what do we\ndo with this information? And the thing that interests me most from\na research perspective, I mean, I did my PhD in false memories, so implanting\nfalse memories of committing crime, which was the study that\nended up going viral because I was the first to do it. And I built\non a history of people implanting false memories of various kinds of other emotional\nevents. But it was the first time someone had combined false confessions research\nand false memory research. And so that was the research of Elizabeth\nLoftus and Saul Kassin. So false confessions was Saul Kassin and false\nmemories was Elizabeth Loftus. And I was just doing them both at the same time. And the\nquestion was, could you get people to believe that they committed a crime that never\nhappened and confess to it? And not just that, but believe that\nit actually happened, so remember it? And the answer to that in short is yes,\nyou can, especially using specific leading and suggestive interview\ntechniques. And so the procedural learning from that, which is what I'm most interested in, I don't,\nlike that's sort of a party trick to be able to actually do it. And that's just so that you can then take\nthat and go, \"Okay, well, how do we prevent this?\" And so I've since\ntrained police lawyers. I've trained people at the ICC, the\nInternational Criminal Court, who deal with collective memory, so they deal with\nhundreds of witnesses at a time in war crimes. And the question\nis, how do we try to preserve as original as possible\nmemory without contaminating it? Because well, or at least without\ncontaminating it any more than it already is. And that's where social psychology, I\nthink, excels, is that we have done lots of research on how social\nsettings change what people say, and to some extent, what people\nbelieve. And I think that's also where actually the leap to things\nlike AI, I think, is not far, because ultimately, the way that\nwe're engaging with large language models and generative AI in general,\nis that it's structured as a social interaction. It's structured as\na conversation most of the time now, and that is what we do. I\nmean, that is literally what I train the police on doing, is how to\nmake sure that you don't distort people's memories in the process and how to ask good\nquestions. So you get confabulations from both sides now. You get confabulations from\nAI and from the people. And the problem is that there's a third thing, which\nis the in-between, that I'm not sure is getting enough attention right now.\nAnd I wish that there was more integration of social scientists\nlike me and people who do investigative interviewing and\nhave done it for decades to understand what is happening in the\nin-between. And so that we can both teach the people and the AI to respond\nbetter in that situation. - I mean, it's really interesting. Are you saying\nthat there's a drift of some kind in terms of on both the AI and human side when they're\ninteracting together that we need to be very clear about? - Yes. What we've created with Gen\nAI is basically the ultimate false memory machine. We have created a tailored experience of something\nthat is most of the time telling you what it\nthinks you want to hear, and then it's uncritically giving\nthat to you. Or sometimes, of course, there are other things where it's\nappraising whether or not this is truthful or not. But it is giving that\nto you. And there's no safeguard from you just going, \"This is\ntruth, and this is my past,\" or, \"This is how I remembered it.\"\nAnd the problem is that not only is AI potentially distorting\npeople and their memories, never mind the factual basis on which\nthey're relying, but it's also the other way around: that potentially by\nasking leading or problematic questions, people are changing\nhow the AI is creating the content, which is in turn on some fundamental\nlevel potentially having an impact on how it's discerning truth\nfrom fiction. And so that's where the false memory in human\nminds and confabulations in AI, I think, are much more similar than we think. And when I first saw AI\nconfabulate, hallucinate, I was like, \"This is what people do all the time.\" It's\njust that we can't fact-check them all the time. We're not in a conversation constantly\nbeing like, \"Well, is that quite right? I'm going to use that\nfor my homework,\" right? So, it's both juicy and really troubling. - Well, right now the interactions are pretty\nephemeral. They're short-lasting, and there's not really a deep memory to the\ninteractions. But this could get a lot worse if the AI is personalized to a degree\nwhere it remembers things about you so that you can then start\nto, over many interactions, feed the narrative about\nyour past that you construct together with the AI over time. - But you don't even need that. So this is what we\nfind in investigative interviewing, which is police interviewing of witnesses and\nsuspects, is that all you need is a leading question or a\nsuggestive piece of information. In a short interaction, most\npeople, most police officers don't spend a long time, and they\nhave no memory of this person's past. They know basically nothing about\nthem except for things related to the crime. And yet we know that\nwithin that very short, maybe half hour, one-hour interaction,\npeople's stories can change fundamentally. And the problem\nis that if you have a memory of something, that when you pull it up, in that social interaction, it's\nsort of live. It's like active. And when you then finish that\ninteraction, it sets back down. And the thing is that if you put it back in a\ndifferent way, what's going to happen is the next time you're going to remember\nthe latest version. And you might not realize that it shifted. So over time,\nit can shift and you don't realize it, and that's your truth. And that's where even just short interactions can have\na profound impact on the human mind. - Wow, so you can modify\nmemories that quickly? - Yeah. We do all the time in experiments. - Okay, can you speak a little bit more\nto false memory? So, like, it's just fascinating. So things\nhappen to us. We humans do things in the world, and then we remember\nthem. And most of our lives, I guess, is lived in memory, in remembering the things\nthat happened to us. And you're saying that we can modify the story we tell\nabout the things that happened to us? That's fascinating. So what do we know\nabout this ability to have false memories? - We know that false memories are\ncommon, that they're a feature of a normal, healthy brain. They're\nnot this glitch, they are a feature. And we know\nthat false memories are incredibly common, in terms of\nif you think about basically any memory... Now, I'm interested in\nautobiographical memories. This isn't memories of facts. This is memories of experiences,\nthings that you've lived in some way. And of those autobiographical\nmemories, basically every single autobiographical memory you have is false.\nThe question isn't whether it's false, the question is how false. You're\ndespairing over there. - Well, I mean, yeah, that's... I mean,\nit's both beautiful and terrifying... ...that nothing is real. - No, that's not, that's\nnot what I'm saying. - Okay. - I'm just saying that everything\nhas a degree of falsehood to it. And this is where sometimes I'll get accused of\nbeing like, \"Oh, but that... does that mean we can never use witness statements?\" That... I'm not\nsaying we can't use any witness statements. I'm just saying that we need to be careful because\neven if people say things with confidence, it doesn't necessarily mean they're true,\nor if they have multisensory details, they're describing in very specific detail\nwhat they smelled, what they heard, what they... whatever. It doesn't\nmean it's necessarily true. Most of the time, our autobiographical\nmemories are good enough. And that's where... memory\nscientists talk about this as gist memory. Our gist memory for\nevents, much like for text, you get the gist of it, right? You're\ngood enough. You generally remember accurately approximately what happened.\nBut it's when you get to the so-called verbatim details, the specific\ndetails of memories that you find people are often really bad. Now, most of the time that doesn't really matter\nbecause you remember you hung out with a friend, you remember you were at this university, you\nremember approximately what your favorite cafe was, you remember this important\nnegative or positive event. Fine. You don't actually need to know exactly what\nyou were wearing and drinking and saying. But in a criminal justice setting, you do\nneed to remember exactly what you were drinking and saying and doing,\nright? And so that's where we have this need to break down this human capacity for memory to this level\nof detail that it's just not made for. - So that's where the verbatim stuff can get\nyou into trouble, 'cause with criminal cases, I suppose the tiniest details really matter 'cause then the\nlawyers can really zoom in on that. particular detail, and then you could\njust make that up. And then the interrogation with a leading question,\nas you were saying, can just alter your memory of a particular\ndetail, and then everything will hang on that detail. - Right, and if that particular detail is someone's\nface, then that's a really big problem. - You're right. - And so, and it can also be an entire false memory. So this is where in my research\nand in research like mine, we've implanted, well, memories,\nwhat we call memories or false memories, of experiences that never\nhappened at all. So while most things are modifications of real memories,\nfalse memories, complete false memories are when you think you experienced\nsomething that you didn't. And we all have them. We all have some\nmemories that can't be true, and we usually realize them, for\nexample, when we talk to our parents about our childhood or when we talk to friends\nand we say, \"Remember that time we did this?\" And your friend will go,\n\"That happened to me, that didn't happen to you.\" And you become what is known\nin research as a memory thief. Where you've stolen somebody else's\nmemory and you've accepted it, or your brain has accepted it as your own.\nAnd that's possibly because the other person told it in such vivid detail that you could\nimagine it, and basically your brain was like, \"Well, this feels real now.\" And\nso the next time you thought about that, maybe, maybe not the next time, but maybe after\na couple of times of thinking about it, you started going, \"This happened to me,\nright?\" And then you integrate it into your autobiography. - How hard is it to insert false memories? - Not hard. It's very easy to distort memories or\nto insert small false memories. It's harder to convince people of entire\nevents, especially specific events. And this is widely debated exactly\nhow easy it is to implant a specific false memory. It's also one of\nthe big debates around my own research is that when I was writing The\nMemory Illusion, which was my first book, and the research that was in\nline with that, there was this huge debate between me and a couple\nof other academics about what it means for something to be a\nfalse memory and how we should talk about the ease with which they're\nimplanted, and that is still one of the biggest scientific debates in\nour field. And to me, I think that's... So the coding stuff\nis about the difference between what some people call\na false belief and a false memory. So I think this thing\nhappened or I remember this thing happened, and that is a really\ndifficult differentiation often because all we have as social\npsychologists is what you're telling me. And I can ask you, \"Do you think\nit really happened or not? Do you believe it really happened?\" But\nit's really hard to differentiate, and so I've always thought that you need to ask\npeople about the specifics, like, \"All right, how confident are you in this memory? All right,\ndo you feel things in this memory? Does it feel like other kinds of mem?\" Right? Sort\nof, like, describe the nature of this experience rather than being like, \"Do\nyou think this is a real memory?\" Because that's a hard thing to ask people to do. - So you want to get indirectly as many\nsignals as possible to show that they actually believe the thing happened. - Or that it approximates a memory in their\nminds. That's right, rather than just a thing they think kind of sort of happened. But other people think that it's an easier\nto differentiate line. So for me, that it's almost impossible to differentiate\nthe two. Other people think it's more clear. And then in terms\nof the frequency, so in my research, 70% of people\nbecame convinced that they committed a crime that never\nhappened or experienced another important emotional event. And that number as well is challenged in that people go,\n\"Well, does that mean that 70% of people can have false memories\nlike this?\" And the answer is no, obviously not. That's just in my\nsample. That's just these specific six false memories. And it could\nbe that I think 100% of people are prone to some version\nof this, just maybe not in this specific study, right? That if I\nhad to come up with different false memories to implant, or if I was a different\nperson myself and people trusted me differently. There are again, those\nsocial factors that make it more or less likely that I'm going to be able to convince you\nthat something happened in your life that you can't remember. And in one study, obviously,\nI can't capture that. But it also doesn't mean that 70% of the time people\nare, you know, it might be 1% of the time or 0.1% of the time that people have\nthese complex false memories. - I guess you're just speaking to the fact that\nyou don't know how representative the sample is. But even from one study,\nthat's a crazy, that's incredible. - Well, it's not - That's a- - ...just representativeness. It's also that\nwe shouldn't take individual studies in that way. - Sure. - Like I'm not saying that 70% of people\nalways have false memories either. Like it's it just means in this one study,\nmore people than not developed these complex memories. - What was the methodology for implanting\nthe false memories? This is so cool, by the way. Human memory is so fascinating, and the fact\nthat we can engineer memory-- - It's good that it's fast. - ...it's so interesting. It's also really\ninteresting that we live so much of our lives in memories. And that you can mess with\nthat, you can shape it. It's interesting. - It's mostly, I think, a good\nthing that we can shape it. - I think so. Yeah. - I think the fact that memory can be false\nin the way that I do it in my study is a result of the fact that our minds\nare made to creatively recombine information to solve problems in the And so even the fact that\nwe have this gist memory, it's because we're optimizing\ndata processing. We're basically saying, \"These are the most\nimportant things from these events, and the other details are irrelevant.\nDon't remember that. Gone. And now I'm going to work with that to\ntry and solve what life comes up with.\" And the ability to be creative\nand intelligent relies on our ability to take memories from the past\nand pieces of them and to creatively recombine them. And so that's what false\nmemories are, except that that then can look bad if you're trying\nto remember something specific. And so in my research, I used leading\nand suggestive questions like, \"Close your eyes. Picture the event that\nI'm trying to implant.\" So I was implanting, for example,\n\"You're 14 years old. You were in contact with the police.\nThe police called your parents, and you assaulted someone with a\nweapon.\" And then the question is, \"What do you remember?\"\nAnd you say to me as a participant, because you've been selected out to\nspecifically never having had this experience... And just to be clear, a weapon, I\ndon't mean a semi-automatic weapon. I mean anything. And usually it was a rock.\nAnd so people would say, \"I found...\" 'Cause a weapon is just anything\nyou use to hurt another person. And I did this study in Canada. We\ndon't have guns in the same way as in some other parts of the world. And so it was\nunlikely that my participants would have been like, \"Yeah, I totally have all these guns.\"\nAnd so they would take something, an object, and hurt somebody else, or they\nstole something, or they hit somebody. So those are three of the conditions.\nAnd I randomly assigned people to them, and they knew that I contacted their\nloved ones ahead of time, so they were participating in a childhood\nmemory study, an emotional childhood memory study, and they knew\nthat. And then I contacted their parents ahead of time to get information about\nwhat they were like as teenagers, where they lived, friends, basic things, and to make sure\nthey hadn't ever experienced any of the target events. And then with that information, I said to the participants,\n\"Okay, so there's these two things your parents reported happening, and one of\nthem is a true one.\" And so I'd always include a true one to build\nrapport, which is, \"I'm doing the what not to do of\ninterviewing, right?\" - Right. - I'm laying it on thick. - To see what's possible. - To see what's possible. Because you\nhave to push it to also show that it's that I can do this in this context\nso that we can warn police to not do this. So I said, \"We have these two\nincidents that your parents reported, and one of them was you had a\nskiing accident,\" blah, blah, blah. one. The second one was an incident where you\nwere in contact with the police, but we'll get to that.\" So we'd first have 20\nminutes talking about the true memory, which people, you know,\nthey're getting going. It feels good. I've got a structured interview as well,\nwhich I'll then mirror in the false memory. So it all feels very legit. And then\nwe get to the second memory, and I say this, you know, I... \"There's this\nother important memory that your parents recalled.\" And then they'd say, \"I don't\nremember that.\" And I'd say, \"Oh, okay. But I have this really detailed account.\nAll you have to do is remember it.\" And then I would do the illusion of\ntransparency, which is a really powerful psychological tool, which is to make people feel like\nthey know what's going on when they don't really. And the thing I would do is just\nsay, \"Well, you know, if you want to, we can do this memory\nretrieval technique called this imagination exercise.\" And I\ndon't like to call it repression, but sometimes we hide away memories that we don't\nlike about ourselves. And I'm using words that people know and mechanisms that people\nhave heard of that are frankly quite disputed in actual science. But\npeople go, \"Oh, well, maybe I did repress this.\" And then everybody says\nyes. Like technically they could say no. They can say, \"No, I don't want to do that.\" But they\ngo, \"Yeah, of course I want to know.\" And so I do this imagination exercise where people close their eyes,\nvery simple, and just imagine what could have happened, basically. And every time\nthey say a detail, my very first detail ever, I remember this because I was\nso excited 'cause they've got their eyes closed, right? And I'm right next to the head of\ndepartment because they were worried 'cause I was a PhD student... that, you know, the\nethics of it, the consequences. Like it took years to get the\nprotocol through ethics and- ...to make sure it was\nsafe. Anyway, I'm s- I'm grinning as the person with their eyes\nclosed says the most trivial detail, \"I remember a blue sky.\" And I\nremember going, \"It's working.\" - Did you know it was\ngoing to happen at all? - Oh, no, I had no idea. I had no idea. - That's so fascinating. - And so from the trivial details, and I'd\nalways say, \"Yeah, good job, good job.\" You know, social reinforcement,\nlittle treat. And they would remember more and more details, and then\nthey'd get more specific, and then they'd tell me who it was they allegedly\nattacked or stole from, where they were. And those details had to come from them because\nI don't know enough about their lives, right? So this is the other thing with false memories;\nit's basing it on lots of real pieces of memories, real places, real people, real\nfeelings. They're just woven together in a way that never happened. And so just\nthree interviews and you've got 70% of people confessing to a\ncrime that never happened. - First of all, great study. Great,\ngreat job all around. To what degree has this been elaborated\non and proven further since? Because it's a super powerful idea,\nwhether it's 70% or any kind of percent. - What I wanted with the study\nis just to show it's possible. - That's really the powerful\nthing, that it's possible. - Right. And so it could've been two people\nand I would've been happy. The fact that it was so possible was frankly\nquite surprising to everybody. And we did in fact cut the study short 'cause we\ntold ethics that we're only going to have like a 13% hit rate. We were like, \"This is\nworking really well. We're gonna stop.\" So, and that was just\nbecause of, you know, how power calculations, whatever. Science. Because science. And since then there have\nbeen other studies on implanting false memories. There have been ones also\nusing AI tools, so like whether or not we remember or think we remember incidents differently or better\nif they were created with AI images of ourselves or videos.\nSo, there was a study that came out, I think it was this year, by\na team including Elizabeth Loftus, which showed that if you\nturn photos of yourself into videos using AI, that you are more likely to believe\nthose things happened in the way that AI is telling you that they did, even though\nAI has absolutely no idea. And then, you are more likely to remember it with\nhigh confidence that it happened in the way that this AI has created it.\nAnd so, we can see that there's lots of versions of this, whether it's\nin interpersonal social interactions or interactions with tech.\nAnd there's a big replication that's happening right now at the\nUniversity of Maastricht of my study, or is about to happen, hopefully\nactually, is where we're at. - There's a lot of questions I want to ask you.\nLike one of them, doesn't this mean that at scale you could have\nsomething like a government use propaganda to mass gaslight a population?\nSo, implant false memories using AI, using, using whatever tools they have? - Yes. That is definitely already happening. - That's terrifying. Is there any-\nanything you've learned about defending against that? I guess knowing that first step is just\nknowing that it's possible. That's already a very powerful\npiece of knowledge. - That's right. So, the first thing that's\nimportant is for people to understand that they are capable of creating these false\nmemories, and that they're not this really unusual, hard-to-generate thing.\nThey're actually a normal memory process. And that insight is why\nI wrote The Memory Illusion, is because I think people need to just understand\nthat their minds work like this, and that they're really glitchy when it comes to the\naccuracy of their autobiographical memories. But again, that that's probably\nultimately a good thing as well in terms of our overall human\nexperience. But then, what happens if you do have an important\npiece of information that's important and not being distorted, right? You are a\nwitness of a crime, for example, and you now know that this is going to be\nimportant. What do you do? And the really simple answer is don't trust your brain.\nJust make sure you write it down. Assume you are going to forget\neverything. Assume you're going to forget no matter how important,\nhow emotional, how intense, how much you say to yourself. This is a failure\nof prospective memory, it's called. \"I will remember.\" You won't. Just assume\nthat you're not going to remember. And the closer you get to the time at which an event happened, and we\ncall this contemporaneous evidence, the closer you get in time, the more high-quality\nthat memory is going to be. And I think there's this myth sometimes that if you're\ndrunk or if you're high or if you're really emotional, that somehow you should\nwait. You should sort of like go home, sleep it off, and\nthen recall your memory. is not what the current advice in\nmemory research actually says. It's in the moment, as soon as possible, write\nit down, record it outside your brain. You can do it again when you wake up, but\nthen at least you have an original version. - Yeah. You used the analogy of a Wikipedia\npage for memory. I think that's a pretty useful way to think about it. It's\nkind of crowdsourced by all the different influences you have, all\nthe different experiences, all the other people, you telling other\npeople about the memory, that all of that edits the page, the\nWikipedia page of your memory. - It does. And collective and\nindividual memory are these really interesting... They interact in a\nreally interesting way. So I would always say when I train, for\nexample, people who go to deal with warlords\nin the German military. I was working with agents who\nwere going abroad and who were in these really difficult situations where they\nhad to remember a lot of information that was important for national security. They couldn't\njust sit there with a tape recorder being like, \"Hey,\" or like, their phone, being like, \"Hey,\nMister Warlord, can you just talk into this a bit closer?\" You can't do that. And so you\nhave to remember it. And so what they were doing is they were coming\nback from their deployments, and they would meet up immediately and have\na team meeting, could be like, \"What did you remember? What happened?\" And the problem is\nthat they would do that before writing their notes, and that is, that is\nthe wrong way around. And so they don't do that anymore because I've\ntold them not to do that anymore. But it feels good. It feels like collectively,\nwe are going to remember more details. Because you do, but it doesn't mean\nthat those details are right. And so that's where I'd always say have\nyour own version before you talk to anybody. Then, and my colleague, Dr. Annalise Fredevelt, is one of the\nexperts on the effect of things like eye closure on memory and\ncollective memory, and she has found, repeatedly, that\nif you remember things together, especially if you've already\ngot an original version of your own, you do usually remember more details. And\nespecially if you are helping each other to remember, like in a relationship. You'll have\nsomeone who's better at remembering certain kinds of details, maybe names or what\nhappened or what you were doing, and the other person's better at\nwhen it happened. And so you can have these complementary memories that\ncome in in social situations, and you can then have more details\nthat are remembered after. - Right, but there are conflicting forces\nhere. So that's true, but also as you said, it's true that\ntogether, you can weave a narrative that never happened.\nSo together, you can solidify the thing that actually\nhappened, maybe if you take notes beforehand. But at the same time, if\nyou don't take notes, then you can just make things up very effectively together\nbecause you're like, yes, ending the whole time, like building together\na castle that's false. - Or distorted. - Distorted. - Yeah. But you can also sometimes go back to your\noriginal account and go, \"Actually, no, that, that was a bit wrong.\" And so my, as again, an analytical person and someone\nwho works as an expert witness on memory cases, I just want to see all the\nversions. I want your version history. I want the complete version history of your memory,\nand then I can tell you whether I think things have gone wrong here. And if so, why? - Have you seen like different versions of\nmemory and they're really conflicting? Like what have you learned about\nmemory from that, that they can be very conflicting? People explain\nthe same experience as very different. - Well, there's different people having very\ndifferent memories of the same experience. And there's the same person having different\nmemories of the same experience. And so I work in both, in some ways,\nas an expert witness, but mostly in the individual changing\ntheir story in a dramatic way. - Ah, yeah. - So a witness or an alleged\nvictim saying that they, you know, having X story\nthe first time they go to the police, and then three years later,\nhaving a very different, sometimes categorically different\naccount. And the question is are they just, were they just too\nshy initially to say what really happened? Were they, were they\nunder pressure from other people? Were they not really\nremembering? You know, why has it changed? Or could it\nbe that they have been undergone some really\nproblematic like hypnotherapy or just shady therapy in general that has like\nconvinced them that things are maybe much worse than they initially remembered?\nAnd it's not that therapy doesn't nec- Like therapy can bring out more\ndetails, for sure, but the problem is that certain kinds of therapy mirror what\nwe do in false memory research in terms of implanting false memories, and it just\nmakes it really messy and you just ... It makes the quality of the evidence\nreally low because we can no longer tell what is because of the therapy\nand what's actually remembered. - This is so fascinating. What are the ways you\ncan possibly figure out which is true, the thing you remembered initially or the thing\nyou're now remembering four years later? - Receipts. That's all you got. You have to\nlook at your original versions. If you only have your version now, the only thing\nyou can look for is evidence that confirms or shows that it\ndidn't happen. If you can't access that, then it ultimately is a matter\nof, especially if you've got like two people saying completely different things, it\nends up being a battle of confidence ultimately. - This is a tricky question,\nbut you mentioned therapy. It does seem like what therapists do is they want to find a problem,\nand they can then just project the problem and then convince you the\nproblem existed. So how do you know... Is like therapy even\nan effective... It takes a very special therapist not to implant,\nright? A trauma that never happened or, or details that never happened\nto a trauma that did. - It depends on the kind of therapy. So there's a\nlot of therapy that is evidence-based and that is very much focused on\ntackling sort of feelings and reactions that you have right now. Then there is an area or a bunch\nof areas of therapy, including psychoanalysis, which are very\nfocused on trying to find retroactively sources of mental\nillness in your personal past. And I am very critical of the kinds of... Well, both from an\nexplanatory perspective, but also from a false memory perspective. I don't\nthink that we are the way we are because of individual incidents that happened to us. I\nthink that is a wild thing to think about the brain. Like to be like you, you are\nthe way you are because of this one interaction you had that one time is\nlike... I mean, maybe this explains a tiny bit of you, but what about all the other\nlife experiences you have every single day? And so I think that there's sometimes an oversimplified\nsearching for answers or sources of problems that we have that sources of problems that we have that I don't like. I don't think it's true. And I think\nthat there can be an uncautious approach to memory, as you were saying, where\nyou have someone who is saying things and your role as a\ntherapist is to help them manage their emotions now and to feel better. That's the other\nthing is that they have a very different role than I do. A therapist is trying to manage\nthe person's well-being now. whereas I am looking at the evidentiary quality.\nThat is a complete... I'm almost like the not quite the other side, but\nI'm in a very different role. - Well, you just want the truth. - Well, I'm criticizing and\nanalyzing their memories, whereas the others, the therapists, are more likely to\nbe trying to help them manage the memories in their day-to-day life. And so it doesn't matter if\nthey're true or not to therapists. What matters is that they're troubling to the people\nthemselves. But once you get into a courtroom setting, as you say... the facts and what actually happened matter.\nAnd it's not just what you remember, it's what actually happened. - Maybe you can speak to the other, the\nnon-courtroom setting, because this is all... The positive side of it\nis you can basically shape your memories to be happier. I mean, I find this in myself. Maybe you\ncould speak to that. If I, you know, look into past relationships, if I just think\nabout, or maybe speak to others about the positive things... really\nthink. Just think, like, I focus my mind on the memory, on the\npositive memories. And then everything just becomes more positive. And I think it\nmakes me feel like I'm way happier about my past. So there\nmust be something to that, 'cause I almost start to forget that\nthe negative stuff happened. And then the same thing on the flip side\nis if you focus on the negative, then the negative stuff just overpowers everything else\nand you have a very heavy negative feeling about your past. So that\nseems, like the way to live a healthy life, a happy life is just to focus\non the positive. Not to sound cliché, but like basically\nmodifying your memories continuously that everything was just\ngreat. Is there something to that? - Well, the essence of that is\nright. There is something called state-dependent memory, which is that you're\nmore likely to remember things that were consolidated or created as memories if they match the state that you're\nin now. So if you are sad now and your brain's just sort of going,\nyou're more likely to remember other sad times because your memory and the\nemotional state of your brain is basically already activating those networks\nof sadness. And it's like, here are some other sad things and shitty\nthings that happened to you. And it's the same with if you are embarrassed. That's the\nclassic one that we usually use as memory researchers, is that moment where you do\nsomething embarrassing and for the next like six hours, all you're thinking of is all the\nother embarrassing things you've ever done. And it's like your brain is like, \"Would\nyou like some other embarrassing stories?\" And obviously you're going, \"No,\nthank you. Please stop,\" but you have this spreading\nactivation, as it's called, of just these synapses, just lighting up\nnew networks, and you're going, \"Ah!\" And there's this other memory that's\nattached to the same feeling. So it's the same with happiness, is that people who\nare happier tend to remember more happy memories. So most of the time,\nunless you're depressed, most people look back at their lives with\na rosy reminiscence bias. They're more likely to remember the\npositives than the negatives. But it's not quite the way you were describing it.\nIt's not quite that you only remember the good, the objectively good things\nthat happened. It's more that your interpretation of the things that\nyou've experienced is either neutral or positive. For me, for\nexample, growing up with my father with apparent\nschizophrenia, that is something that I see as a net positive. So obviously at the time, it was\nexperienced in a complicated way, but in hindsight, it defined my life and\nit completely gave me a perspective of the human mind that I just wouldn't\nhave had otherwise. So I see that as a positive part of my\nautobiography, and that is what good therapy should be doing. It should\nbe taking negative experiences and not overwriting them or changing them.\nOur brains do that naturally anyway. But trying to work with what you've\ngot, the experiences, the true experiences, but then just\nshifting the emotional content so that how you're dealing\nwith them now is good. - How much of what this Daniel Kahneman\ntype of idea is, that we live a lot of our life in memory? Like, it's not, you know, there's\nthe direct in the moment experience of a thing, and then\nthere's remembering that thing over and over and over and over. So there's\nlike, I don't know, getting married or whatever, like some pleasant thing that\nif you, over a lifetime, the pleasure you derive from that thing is\ndisproportionately, most of it is from remembering the thing we're\nexperiencing it. Is there something to that? - I think so. And his experiments\nwhere he asked participants if they were offered this holiday\nthat they could go on-- ...but they wouldn't remember it. So\nthey'd have the present-day experience of enjoyment on this holiday, I think it was\na tropical vacation or something that he'd offer people. And he then said,\n\"Well, but you're not going to be able to remember this. Would you still go?\" And\na lot of people say, \"No, I wouldn't go on that holiday if I can't remember it.\" I\nthink that's interesting, and I think that sort of \"pics or it didn't happen\", so\nthat the social media generation obviously is perhaps even more in line\nwith that, also in terms of how you deal with that in a social context.\nSharing those memories with others and those experiences and which experiences\nend up being the important ones in our lives. - Yeah, there's a real case to\nbe made. There's this kind of ridiculous thing that happens now\nwhenever something cool is happening. People take out their phones and film it.\nBut the case for that is that, yeah, this gives you something to look back at. So it's\nworthwhile to take a picture, actually. - Although it's even more worthwhile to pay attention.\nAttention is the glue between reality and memory. And so if you're using\nyour phone to not have to pay attention and not have to put any work into\nremembering it, then you're going to look at that picture later and go, \"What was this?\" 'Cause you've tried to outsource it\nin a way that our brains don't work. - How hard is it to modify\nmemories from a neuroscience perspective? So if you look at\nbrain-computer interfaces like Neuralink, for example, do you think there's\na future where we're implanting or modifying memories directly? - Yeah, I mean, that's basically what we\ndo as human beings already, and I don't see why tech couldn't do\nexactly the same thing. - Just speed that up. So right now, we\ncould do that with language, right? We just talk to each other and modify\nthem, and we just speed that up. - Language, but also thinking about it yourself.\nSo you can, it's called autosuggestion when you suggest things to yourself that\ndidn't happen. And that often comes from reading something or seeing something or\nthinking about something or hearing somebody else's story and going, \"Did something like that\nhappen to me?\" And then you start picturing it and thinking about it, in what context it could\nhave. And then you start to basically implant a false memory in yourself. And so that can\nhappen as well. And I think with things like Neuralink, it would be the same where\nyou'd have the ability to do that. And, but again, I still think that\nthis interaction between humans and AI or AI-like systems is... it is the same as a social interaction,\nwhich is why I was saying it's so important, I think, that we have social\npsychologists in the room, because ultimately, whether it's an AI or another\nperson, it's the same brain that you're modifying. - So what you're worried about there is that\nyou become untethered from reality, like you fabricate too many details about\nthe memory? Like, if a human is interacting with AI, and the AI is\ntelling the human what they want to hear, are you worried about over\ntime you start to just have a very overly modified version\nof your past narrative? - I'm not necessarily worried\nabout the fact that AI and generative AI can\ncreate false memories. That is, again, something we've also been doing\nfor a long time. Like modified photos is something pre-AI that we had that\nwas already messing with people's minds. Even just what you have in\nthe frame of a shot. So if you take a holiday snap and you're omitting,\nlike, a really important part of what actually happened on that holiday, 'cause you're taking a\npicture of the nicest part and not the, you know, the garbage behind you... That is going to have an impact on your\nmemory as well. And so we've... that... Versions of that have always existed.\nAnd historically, if you go even further back, I mean, in some ways we've never\nbeen closer to facts than we are now. There's this whole idea of like, \"Oh, we're\nliving in this post-truth,\" or blah, blah, blah. But that is not\ntrue. I mean, we didn't even know how to write for a long\ntime. We had no way of reliably cataloging information, never\nmind the scientific method, never mind reliably sharing it with\none another or fact-checking quickly with things like Google.\nSo I mean, we're so close to facts, but that in some ways I think\nis the... The worry is that we've gotten comfortable feeling like we can just\naccess things that aren't modified or that are less likely to be modified, and now\nthey're more likely to be. And that can interface with our memories. - So just a practical... Is\nthere like a protocol for self-modifying memories so\nyou can live a happier life? - There is, yeah. It's called\ncognitive restructuring. When you actively, deliberately\nchange an aspect of a memory usually for some therapeutic\noutcome, so to be happier, to be better in some way. - That's really interesting, right? Not just\nfor if you have some kind of issue, but just how to have a life well\nlived. Right? Does that work? - Yeah, it totally works. I do it all\nthe time. Again, it's about thinking about experiences you've had, positive or\nnegative. Usually the negative are the ones we need to work on more.\nAnd thinking instead of, \"Wow, how terrible was that?\" Thinking, \"What\ndid I learn from that? What has this given me that other people haven't experienced?\nWhat is it that it taught me me about who are my friends? What\nare these insights that I've won from this experience?\"\nAnd so I think that is an important part of resilience that we ideally\nneed to celebrate and teach more than ... the opposite, which is\nhanging in the negatives. - That's probably really good for relationships\ntoo, right? Together you form the collective memory, and you work on that.\nYou can just fabricate or modify towards the positive. - Well, with relationships, one of my\nfavorite research on memories is that if you ask people in\nrelationships who does most of the housework or who does most of certain\nthings, the numbers that they give you... So like someone will say, \"I do 60%.\"\nThe other person will say, \"I do 50%,\" and you add them up, that's more\nthan 100%, and that's basically always the case. And o- on lots of different\nfronts, people will claim that they do more, and if you ask them how much their\npartner does, they will diminish it. And so one of the tips I always say for relationships\nin terms of memories is actually just sharing what you're actually doing. So if you've... Initially it feels a\nbit cumbersome because it's quite unnatural to be like, \"I've just taken\nout the rubbish. I've just taken out the bins,\" or, \"I've just booked us a hotel.\" But saying it out loud means\nthe other person is able to perceive it and then can add it to\nsort of their internal, like, star chart of how much you've done in\nthe relationship. And they're more likely to And they're more likely to actually\nperceive what you're contributing. memories we do, and that they... \"Of\ncourse she remembers that I took out the bins, but not necessarily. She might not\neven have really perceived it. But if She might not even have really perceived it. But\nif you're reminding each other of all the things - that you're doing, it can feel more balanced\nover time. This memory is just so fascinating. Is it possible, this is a little bit outside of\nthe topic of false memories, but is it possible to train memory? Like, what have you\nunderstood about memory? Can it be improved? - Yep, it can be improved, and\nthere are now some really good brain training apps\nas well that can help to get people to work\nbetter with attention, to have N-back tests, so remember\ninformation, a couple of pieces of information back. So,\nwhat did I tell you three sentences ago? There's all of these kinds of, well, games effectively\nthat you can play that will in fact train how your brain is using its networks. There was one that was developed by\nresearchers, including researchers at the University of Bonn in Germany, and it's called\nNeuroNation, and that's one that I like because it's all these really\nshort games. And the idea is that doing one thing, like Sudoku or whatever,\nthe sort of classics, to train your brain, that is only going to be useful up\nto a point because it's then the same thing over and over again. And what you want to be\ndoing is lots of different kinds of tasks so that your brain has to remain flexible.\nAnd so, short and many is the answer rather than one thing hard. It's almost\nthe opposite of expertise. - Yeah, so in doing this regularly,\nlike keeping your mind sharp... That's interesting. I'm\nterrible at remembering names. - Me too. - Is there a trick to doing that? - I don't know 'cause I'm also terrible at\nremembering names. Allegedly, there are tricks and it's mostly to make the information more\nsticky by making it a bigger network in the brain. And so, usually\nwhen you hear a name— especially like you and I,\nit's like, gone immediately. - Yeah. - And that's partly because... I like to think the\npositive of that is because we're focusing on other things about the person. - Right. Yes. - Like, what are they like? What are they... You\nknow, what's this next interaction going to be? Maybe you're a bit nervous about what\nthey're gonna say or what you're gonna say. You're already thinking a step ahead in terms of\ninterpreting the situation. And it's quite an overwhelming situation when you first meet\nsomebody because there's a lot to take in. And so if, however, a name is\nimportant, then you need to, A, remember to focus when they actually\nsay their name and tune out the other stuff, which can be really difficult.\nAnd then to give yourself a mnemonic of, \"How do I remember\nthis name?\" So you could have a visualize something. You could have\na weird word game or some sort of, like, rhyme that you create for\nthe person. You can say, you know, \"Julia with the big ears.\" Like,\nwhatever works for you, as long as it sticks. Now, there's a caveat that\nI recently discovered about myself in terms of why I might not\nhave... I have particularly bad memory for names. All of\nthese mnemonic devices that have mostly rely on creating\nelaborate pictures in your mind. So, like memory champions, people who do\ncompetitive remembering, will tell you that they create these really\nelaborate images in their heads. I recently discovered\nthat I have apantasia. Aphantasia is the inability\nto create mental imagery. And so when I was trying these techniques, I\nwas going, \"None of these are working for me.\" And it turns out it's because\nI don't see anything, whereas other people actually see pictures in their\nmind. And so I think there's some individual differences stuff going on\nthere that we haven't quite understood. - So you're not able to visual... Can\nyou imagine a castle in your head and look at it? - No. So the memory palace\nidea is absurd to me. - Wow. - But the... So the test for aphantasia\nis really easy, which is close your eyes and picture a red apple. - You can't picture a red apple? - And I just see black. - Wow. - Yeah. And there's a scale. So\nsome people are hyperphantasic, where they can have a really\nelaborate version of the apple. And other people have, like, a gray\nsort of outline. And I have nothing. - Wait. How does your memory work? If\nyou think about a past event, are you... Wait. Am I visualizing a past\nevent, or am I just thinking about it? - Oh, that's the question.\nOr is it just a concept? - I think it might be... I might be\noperating in the space of concepts. - Hmm. 'Cause I do, and I think that's why\nI'm so interested in concepts and ideas. And we know that people with aphantasia are less\nlikely to care about their childhood memories because they can't visualize them. - I'm trying to think if I can visualize\npeople's faces from the past. I have a feeling like I can. - Ooh, but are you seeing anything? - Am I actually seeing it? I\ndon't know. I think I'm... I actually reduced those people\ndown to a few concepts about the characteristics of their face, and I\nmight be visualizing the concepts. Boy. - Interesting, right? And most people with aphantasia don't realize\nthey have it until they have this kind of conversation. I didn't know. - I don't know if I can visualize\nthe red apple now. Oh, boy. Yeah. Yeah, 'cause I... The memory\npalace thing has never really worked for me either. I tried. Interesting. Okay. - I have a hypothesis that people\nwho are analytical are more likely to... I think it intersects with\nother things. 'Cause a lot of my friends, it turns out, have aphantasia, and I\nthink it's... There's a version of intelligence, I think, that it might be related to,\nor an interest in certain kinds of concepts that it's related\nto. But I don't know- - I'm going to... Okay. - 'cause it's early days\nof research on this. - All right. This conversation totally is\nleading me to do some soul-searching on many fronts. You have done incredible work across a number of disciplines.\nI mean, from sexuality to evil to memory, and now in your upcoming book, Green Crime: Inside the Minds\nof the People Destroying the Planet and How to Stop Them. Can\nyou speak to the psychology of the people, the organizations,\nthat are killing Earth, as you describe, including illegal gold\nminers, animal traffickers, con men who falsify data and bribe regulators\nto keep polluting, and many other types of criminals? Is there a\npsychology similar to the psychology of some of the folks\nwe've been talking about? - So, the book Green Crime is really an\nexperiment for me in whether we can apply criminological and\ncriminal psychology ideas to the area of environmental\nprotection and crimes. Because there are people who are\nconvicted of crimes, who are convicted of crimes specifically in\nrelation to destroying the Earth and our natural resources, our shared\nresources. I sometimes think about the Earth as like a house, and if\nsomeone was coming into your house and just setting things on fire and\nthen walking out unpunished, you'd be really upset, and correctly so.\nOr poisoning your water, or just leaving a bunch of garbage all over\nyour house. And that's what people are doing on a planetary scale.\nAnd the question is, are we responding effectively? And\nif so, who? Who is responding effectively? And then what is the\nadequate punishment? How should we deal with the people who we catch?\nSo in this book, the question was, are the people who are, for example, I use the Dieselgate Volkswagen\ncase, which was all about lying about the emissions that were\nbeing produced by diesel cars, especially in the United States. And so Volkswagen, for 10 years,\nproduced these cars that had what was called a defeat device,\nwhich is a specific device that makes it look like the cars\ndon't emit very much nitrous oxides, but they actually were\nway over the legal limit for pollution. Now, why we should care\nabout nitrous oxides is because there is no bottom limit\nof nitrous oxides that is healthy for the human\nlung. So basically, any amount is bad for you. And it's\nrelated to things like asthma. It's related to things like premature death.\nIt's related to all kinds of negative, immediate health effects.\nAnd this is what was being pumped out of these cars\nat wildly high rates, 40 times the legal rates in some\ncases, and they just lied about it. They just covered it up.\nThey didn't... Well, some of the people, there's a big debate within the\nVolkswagen people who've been convicted. A lot of people say, \"I didn't\nreally know. I'm being scapegoated.\" Fine, people knew. The question,\nhow much and who, that's up for debate, but certainly people knew cause they had to\ncreate the thing. They had to literally create this piece of software to put into the cars. And\nthen when they got caught, they lied about it, and eventually the truth\ncame out, but it was like 10 years later. And so the question\nis, what leads people, clever people? These aren't idiots.\nThese are clever engineers who are literally working on emissions.\nThey know exactly what these emissions do to people. They know exactly how\nharmful they are. What leads people like that to lie about it, to\ncreate these things and to continue lying when they are caught? And so that is one of the cases I cover in\nit, and I'm looking at it more as a case study for this kind of crime,\nwhich is the corporate collective crime and the lying, and just what leads people in these settings to\nlie and to cover up each other's crimes and to conform to these new norms, these harmful environmental\nnorms. And so I look at it in that way, and then in other chapters,\nI look at people going undercover and uncovering poaching gangs. And there\nit's somewhat procedural where it's more, I didn't know that\nthere were undercover agents infiltrating poaching\ngangs. I didn't know that Interpol was involved in all of these kinds\nof environmental crime and how it gets quite exciting in some of these\ncases where you really see the people who are trying to hold people accountable. - What are the different ways to fight\nenvironmental crime that you describe? - So, what I found most\ninteresting in researching for Green Crime... So, I was speaking to\npeople from the United Nations who are doing these huge research reports\non things like the international trafficking in wildlife crime. I was\ntalking to people who were infiltrating at the EIA, the Environmental\nInvestigation Agency. It's like the undercover police of the Earth,\nand they're infiltrating these organized crime groups, these gangs\nthat are involved in poaching and other activities. I was talking to this\nInterpol agent, and I think all of these people were talking about very different\nways of measuring environmental crime and of responding to it. So,\ndepending on who you talk to, the answer will be very different,\n\"How do we fight crime?\" And the answer is also very different potentially\nthan in other kinds of crime that are more commonly discussed, like violent crime.\nSo, initially, when I started trying to apply criminal psychology to\nthese really big crimes that are often also multi-level, where you've got\nbosses, you've got this, whether it's a corporate boss or an illegal gang\nboss. You've got the middlemen. You've got the people on the ground who actually\nhave the guns who are killing people or animals, or logging or polluting. And\nthen you've got all these levels of people, and that makes it very different\nfrom the kinds of crimes that we often talk about in other kinds of\ntrue crime, for example, where it's one person, maybe a couple of people\nagainst one other person or a couple of other people. And so the scale\nis so tiny normally, and it's mostly violent crime, which\nis mostly arguments. It's bad decisions. It's people who are frankly\noften quite vulnerable themselves, like substance users, people with mental\nhealth problems, people who are sleeping rough. These are not healthy, normal\npeople most of the time who are perpetrating bad crimes. And yet in this context, in environmental crime, this is\nwhere I couldn't apply the research directly, you've got some of the smartest\npeople in the world who are still engaging in fraud, who are engaging in\nthe cover-up of financial information, who are creating shell companies in order\nto hide certain things for poaching, the proceeds of poaching. You've got people who\nare out there illegally fishing, and someone's insuring the vessel that has been literally\nregistered by Interpol as a criminal vessel for 10 years, and\nsomeone's going, \"I'll insure that.\" And so you've got these\nreally complicated other factors going on, but I thought that's\nwhat was so interesting is ultimately stripping back each layer of each\nof these crimes and going, \"Who is that person?\" Who is the person who's insuring this? Who is the person who\nis out there engaging in illegal fishing on the boat? Who is the person\nwho's financing the boat? Who is the person who's investigating them, right? And so, looking at all\nthe different levels, and I think that's where you get some clarity. And actually, at\nthe end of the book, for me, I felt so optimistic. I\nwent into Green Crime because I, like most people in the\nworld, at least according to a recent UN climate survey... Something like 85 to 90%\nof people in the world think about the climate crisis on a regular basis. Most\npeople think about it every single day. So, this idea that there's this\nminority of people who care about climate change, that's an illusion.\nThat's not true. And if you ask people what the emotional\nconsequences are of those feelings, it's people say things like\neco-anxiety, anger, sadness, grief, that we're, you know, we're worried about\nthe future. But what you want is for people to feel motivated,\nenergized, purposeful about tackling one of the biggest issues\nof our time. And certainly by meeting all of these UN researchers, but I went to so many conferences. You have\nno idea how many conferences I went to. I went to anti-corruption conferences. I\nwent to wildlife crime conferences. I went to the specific meeting of multilateral\nagreements to see how people were negotiating in the room and the tensions\nbetween... It was wild. It's so interesting. It's such a huge space, and\nit gave me so much hope for the future. - And actually, the way you frame it, very clearly is a crime against Earth.\nSomehow that's more actionable. And it's less controversial and divisive\nbecause climate change, as a topic, has become like a political issue. Where it's like, is it really\nhappening? Is it like... What's the right policies? It's nice\nto look at actual obvious criminals. - Yeah, where no one's debating, \"Did someone just\nburn down this rainforest?\" It's like, well, we can see it. I was at a European\nSpace Agency conference recently, and they're telling us all about\nthe different satellites that are imaging, sort of pointing at the Earth rather than out into\nspace, and that are imaging through all these different wavelengths exactly what's changing.\nAnd they're basically just chronicling how the Earth has changed over time. And a\nlot of these environmental crimes can be seen from space and can be measured.\nAnd so, like, as long as you trust those data, the question then\nis, okay, so these crimes are happening. How do we stop them?\nAnd as you say, I was very much trying... I mean, you can't write a\nbook on environmental issues and be apolitical. I think that's impossible.\nBut I certainly was trying to look at it quite logically and go, \"Here's a crime.\nWe all agree this is bad.\" And they have, these are people who have been convicted.\nThis isn't just someone who didn't do their recycling. Because also, I think\nthat individual level is often detrimental. But these are huge, huge crimes that cost us a huge amount of\nmoney to clean up and that cost a huge amount of human health and,\nyou know, have these other knock-on effects and are changing,\ncertainly, the structure of our planet in a way that we\ncan feel already. And so, that is the purpose of the book is to try\nand show that we actually have lots of laws already. We've got lots of enforcers.\nWe've got lots of researchers on it from space and not space looking at these issues,\ntracking them, and trying to hunt down the criminals. - So what can you say about how people end up doing bad\nstuff in a company when there's a lot of them? Are they bad people?\nHow do you get to that place where you, in a large collective,\nare doing something really bad? - So, the psychology of\nenvironmental crime I find often boils down to the same kinds of things\nthat we have already been talking about in the context of, quote, unquote,\n\"evil,\" where it's things like conformity. So, doing what you think everyone\nelse is doing, or know what everyone else is doing. So there's an industry\nwhere you know that lots of people are cheating or\nare fudging the facts in some way. Then you both feel\nthe need and also maybe rationalize the ability\nto also deceive because it's market forces, right? Like, ultimately,\nin a free market or even a controlled one, you've got these people\nwho are just lying to everybody else. And they're saying,\n\"We're getting to these X outcome by following the rules that everyone else is.\" And\nthey're not. They're just lying to consumers. They're lying to the regulators. They're\njust lying. And then other people who are trying to be honest and\nyou know, play the game clean, they see the success of\nthis other company and go, \"Well, we want to have what they have.\" And\nthen they realize they can't, with the tech that exists, get there. And so\nwhat do they then realize is, \"Well, they must be cheating.\" And so then they start\ncheating, and so it has this trickle effect of making everyone else\nfall in line with these, well, unethical practices that\nare unethical on so many levels. And then later, you get these\nhuge lawsuits because if you know, if you get caught, then everyone's\nupset. The investors are upset. The consumers are upset. The environmentalists, the\nlawyer, everybody's upset with you because you have committed this huge crime. - Yeah, I mean, you explain so\nmany forces there, but even the simple force of social pressure. like very slight social pressure.\nI was just watching this, documentary based on a book, Ordinary\nMen, talking about the Germans in Nazi Germany that were taking\npart in the execution squads in Eastern Europe and that they\nwere given the option not to do it, and ultimately, most people\ndecided to keep being part of the execution squad even though\nthey had no hatred in their heart seemingly whatsoever. It's just slight social pressure. You\ndon't want to be the guy that kind of chickens out. Just a little bit of social\npressure, and you are able to very quickly dehumanize a large number\nof people and to murder them without any hate in your\nheart, without anything that could trivially, directly be\nidentified as, quote, unquote, \"evil.\" Just normal people\ndoing very bad things. - And you can be an emissions engineer\nwith a kid with asthma and an old grandma who's struggling with her health\nand still feel like, \"Yeah, I know that I'm creating these dirty cars, and yet I'm\ngoing to do it anyway.\" Because as you say, there's the conformity, the social pressure,\nthe rationalization, and those are all very human experiences. And\nthat's why also in the book I always focus on... whistleblower is\na big word, but like people who at some point actually helped\nto uncover what was going on. And if we're back to the topic of heroes, we're back to bystander effects.\nWe're back to all of the social psychology and criminal psychology that we've been talking about\nthis whole time, which is why I thought it was so important to apply that research to this\ncontext and to say, \"Okay, so now we've got these people who are willing to engage in\nthese crimes. They know it.\" But there's also this moment of how do you get out of it,\nand who is going to stop them? And back to the idea of heroes, and you do usually\nin these cases at some point have a hero, either an external one or an internal\none who goes, \"This needs to stop.\" - Do you have empathy for those criminals? - I have empathy for everybody. - Has that ever been in your life challenged,\nlike where you had trouble empathizing? - Ooh. There is one context.\nSo there is one context that I... I don't know if it's that I have\ntrouble empathizing... I think it is I have trouble empathizing, and I just think\nit is... I don't want to. And I don't know why this is the one thing, but I\nremember writing Evil and I got to the section on sexual slavery, and there was\nsomething about that very specific issue of having women, in particular, in\na confined area where you have often trafficked them, and then\nyou're forcing them to engage in repeated sexual acts that\nthe person who is running that— - It's tough for you. - I can't. That's like the... I\nknow that, I'm not saying that that's the worst kind of crime. I don't think\nit necessarily is. I just think from my mind, there was just a, \"You can't go\nthere.\" That's... I don't know how to empathize with that person. - Yeah, I have... I probably have a bunch of\ncategories of people. Stuff with kids is just like- ... it's tough. It's tough.\nIt's tough. What gives you hope about this beautiful world of ours, about the\nfuture of human civilization, given all the darkness that you have studied? - I think the fact that there are people\nwho study the darkness gives me hope, and that there are people who\nwant to understand why we do bad things, myself included, but I\nmostly get to benefit from other people's research that I summarize\ninto my books. And I think that, I think that the tech\nthat we are now experiencing mostly also gives me hope, in that there\nis this whole new frontier of capacity to implement scientific findings if\nwe want to do so, and choose to do so. Like also even in memory\ninterviewing, we were talking about the potential role\nof AI in distorting our memories. I, when I do talks, when I do\ncorporate talks, I tell people the prompt that I use to use the cognitive\ninterview, which is the best practices in memory interviewing, because you\ncan also tell AI tools to do the appropriate kind of interviewing\nif you're talking about memory things. And I created a company called Spot\nin 2017, which uses... Well, we're now building it out to be AI, but it's basically\na tool to record important emotional memories and to share them as information with\nothers. So that, I've always been interested in how tech can help us to record important emotional events,\nlike with Spot, Talk to Spot. and how technology can actually make\nus feel more human. So there are these capacities like memory that we're\nbad at, and tech can help us to overcome some of those shortcomings,\nas long as we use it in a science-backed way rather than just sort\nof freestyling. I think the worry I have sometimes is that, as I've said\nbefore, we're sort of ignoring the social scientists entirely sometimes\nwhen building these systems. And it ends up becoming this engineering math problem,\nwhen that's not actually, in terms of the consequences for humanity, what\nit's going to be. And so I'm always keen on connecting social\nsciences and big issues. - Can you speak more to Spot? This\nsounds fascinating. So what, what's entailed in recording\nimportant memories? - So Spot came out of my going around the world and giving everyone an\nexistential crisis. So I'd go around and like with you, I'd say, \"Look, our memory\nis really faulty, and here are all the ways it can lie to us.\" And people would go,\n\"Oh, no.\" And then I'd go, \"Bye.\" - That's funny. - At some point, I was like, \"Maybe\nI should do something about this.\" And so I did. And so I went\nto a... Well, I did a TED Talk, and I was invited to this tech\nconference called Founders Forum, which is this sort of meeting of tech founders and\nothers in London, but also in a couple other places. And I was invited\nto this, and while there, I met the founder of Evernote- ... Phil Libin. And so I met Phil Libin at this\nevent, and I was talking to him about my research on memory and how\nI've been wanting to implement or translate what I've been doing into\nsomething that could prevent false memories. And specifically,\nI was interested in creating an AI or at least machine-administered\nversion of the cognitive interview. So that's the neutral approach. It's already a scripted approach,\nwhich was helpful. So it's been scripted for decades, or a couple of decades.\nIt's been scripted for decades as a cognitive interview. And when we train police\non how to do it in places like the UK, it's literally just asking people\nto basically read a script that we have fine-tuned over\nthe years. And what can do that really well? Well, chatbots can\ndo that really well. And so together with Phil Libin and my two\nco-founders, Dillon and Daniel, I ended up co-founding Spot,\nwhich is talktospot.com if you want to check it out. And it ended up pivoting into this general\nreporting tool for workplaces. where this was before Me Too, but it was the idea\nbeing that in lots of workplace environments, in lots of workplace environments, you have important\nemotional events that are really important to understand, but are really hard to\npreserve. And often you have this really bad evidence that you're relying on. Someone\nat some point sort of goes to HR and says something, and somebody else says something else,\nand you're sort of unsure as a company maybe who to, whom to trust, what's real. And so, we\nwere trying to streamline that. And so, now Spot is a reporting tool\nfor any kind of compliance issues. And so, you can talk\nto Spot, it's called, and it is this chatbot interface that administers the\ncognitive interview and then creates a report that then gets sent, if you want, to your employer.\nSo we work with, like, insurance companies, medical companies. We work with the Bar. So all\nthe lawyers in the UK use it themselves, which I always think is a real stamp of approval\nwhen the Bar Council is using your tool. - Nice. - But again, not bars and\ndrinks. Bars and lawyers. - Yes. - But... - Thank you for clarifying. - Just picturing all these, like... ...people, like, with flair throwing vodka\nbottles in the air. Not, not them. Um... - They're great too, but yeah. - They could also use it, potentially. But we've got people reporting like, you know, someone\nleft bleach in a machine. So it's like a more small memory. So it's\nstreamlining reporting processes. - I mean, can you envision something\nlike Spot being used for recording generally important emotional events,\npositive and negative throughout your life? That seems like something the LLMs\nof today would really benefit from. - Yeah. Again, that's why... - Just so you're not just strictly\nlooking at like compliance or in the context of companies? - So, in the context of Spot, yes, it's just\ncompliance and it's that. But I think in sort of private life and in terms\nof where I think this could go, I'm interested in all memories, and I think\nthat important life events can be recorded. life events can be recorded. And\nI think the idea of having like grief bots and having things that\nhave a representation of you or your loved ones, I think that's something\nthat I'd like seeing in the future. I would. I'd like seeing in the future. I would. - Have you gotten a chance to\nwork with maybe the Gemini team or OpenAI folks, or any of them?\nAnthropic? Because it seems like they don't have enough people\nthat think about this. - Well, I'm just waiting for an email. - Okay. Wow. - Maybe I'll get one after this. - I'm hanging... - Hit me up, guys. - Yeah, I'm hanging out with DeepMind folks. That\nwould be really, that'd be really fascinating to see. First of all, the\nproper cognitive interview, that's really interesting. That's really\ninteresting how to not lead, how to not to plant false memories. I don't think\nany of them are thinking about that. - I don't think so either. And then how\nto make sure that you're using that to help people to store contemporaneous\nevidence outside of their brain. I just think there's so much potential\nthat's being wasted right now. - Yeah. So the hope is that technology and that there's people being willing to\nempathize with all different flavors of the human condition, that's your\nsource of hope for the future? - And to celebrate all the people who are\ndoing amazing research and really cracking down on things like environmental\ncrime and like spending their lives to fight specific kinds of crime. - Yeah, I like this Earth. I\nhope, I hope we fight for it. It's the only one we got, and I'm pretty\nhesitant to say that maybe in this galaxy, we might be the only ones. So let's, let's protect it. Well, what's\nyour name again? Just kidding. Julia, this is a huge honor.\nI've been a fan of yours for a long time. I'm really glad we got a chance\nto talk. This was really fascinating. Your work is fascinating, and you're just\na fascinating human being, so thank you. - Thank you. - Thanks for listening to this conversation with\nJulia Shaw.
