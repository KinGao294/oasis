  "full_text": "- T. rex is definitely weird,\neven compared to all the other giant tyrannosaurs that are\nvery closely related to it, because it is by far, ludicrously by far,\nthe largest carnivore in its ecosystem. - So it doesn't really have\ncompetition, actually. - I mean, this is a Velociraptor\nskull. There are some carnivores that are a bit bigger than\nthis, but not enormously so which were knocking around as\nT. rex. The skull's the same type. ...toothed crap. But, like,\nyou think about that. And that's like going to Africa and going, \"Okay, there are lions.\nWhat's the next biggest predator? And it's like, well,\nthere's a weasel about this big. Like, it's that kind\nof size difference and you don't get that normally in ecosystems. - It would eat those, the juvenile\nof the herbivores, but not... - Oh yeah, it's gonna be eating Triceratops\nand Edmontosaurus and Parasaurolophus. There's even a couple of giant\nsauropods knocking around. - Got it. - In some places it's gonna be\nhoovering them up, but like, how often is it gonna eat... Again,\nVelociraptor isn't there, but how often is it gonna eat something the\nsize of an adult Velociraptor? I mean, they're a fraction of our\nsize and we're probably too small. This is like lions hunting mice.\nLike, you're just not gonna bother, unless one, like, virtually runs into your\nmouth, you're not gonna try and eat it. - The following is a\nconversation with Dave Hone, a paleontologist, expert on\ndinosaurs, co- host of the Terrible Lizards podcast,\nand author of many scientific papers and books on the behavior and\necology of dinosaurs. This was truly a fun and fascinating conversation.\nThis is the Lex Fridman Podcast. To support it, please check out our\nsponsors in the description and consider subscribing to this channel.\nAnd now, dear friends, here's Dave Hone. Let's start with the T. rex dinosaur, possibly the most\niconic predator in the history of Earth. You have deeply studied and\nwritten about their evolution, biology, ecology, and behavior,\nso let's first maybe put ourselves in the time of the dinosaurs and\nimagine we're standing in front of a T. rex. What does it look like?\nWhat are the key features of the dinosaur in front of us? - It's gigantic. It's almost trite now because everyone knows T. rex is\nmassive. But yes, if you actually stand in front of one, you would\nbe seriously impressed just how absolutely vast they are. So\nI've got a copy of a T. rex skull in my downstairs from my office and yeah,\nI could fit comfortably through its mouth. So it would be just about capable of\nswallowing me whole, and I'm a pretty big guy. - Your body, you could fit-\n... in it's, its mouth? - I can fit through, I can fit through it. - Wow. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's not even a particularly\nbig one. It's a copy of the one that's in the Smithsonian, and\nthey get bigger than that. - You have a to-scale copy. - Yeah, it's a cast, so it's just\na giant mold made and then- - Nice. - ...pulled out like the dentist do your\nteeth, but very, very big. So yeah, they are 12-ish meters long, so what's\nthat? 14 yards. Four and a half, maybe five to the top of the head, standing\nup. So another six yards high. And then seven-ish metric\ntons. What's that? About eight and a half short tons.\nSo a colleague of mine, Tom Holtz, described them as an orca on\nland, but that's it. It is a killer whale-sized animal but on legs, on land. And those are massive\npredators. So you're looking at something absolutely\ncolossal, and I think that is what will stun you. I think people don't\nrealize how big a lot of animals are, which\nsounds weird, but I used to work in a few zoos, and something I think\nyou notice is when you go and see things like elephants or giraffes or rhinos,\neverything's built to the scale of the animal. The elephant house\nis huge. The doors are huge. The bars are huge. The food\nis huge. And so you don't see them in the context of\nsomething that you have a good frame of reference for. And I learned\nthis, yeah, when I was at London Zoo and was going into the basement of the old elephant and rhino pavilion, and a rhino\nstuck its head out from like this gap in the wall, and the head was\ntwice the size I thought it was once you stood next to it. And the same\nwith an elephant. I once stood next to an elephant closer than you are to\nme now, and you go, \"Oh, they are so much bigger than I thought.\"\nAnd I think it's similar in museums. Like even when you get\nup relatively close to a T. rex skeleton, there's a bit of space\nbetween you and it, and then some bars. And then it's usually raised up a\nlittle bit on a mount, on a little mount to hold the platform. And then you\nstand back from that, and you don't actually get to stand like\nunder them. And when you do that, you realize that, yeah,\nthe foot finishes at my knee. - So is a T. rex bigger than an\nelephant? That'd be fair to say? - Yeah, I mean, a very large savanna African elephant is five to six tons,\nand we're looking at seven plus. And a biped and a carnivore. So yeah, you know, a big lion. A big lion\nis 200 kilos. So 430 pounds. Yeah. - Well, that's what, that's why I mean, it's\nwhy they consider it to be probably the most epic predator in\nthe history of Earth. - Yeah, I mean, and I think more than that, it's\nI think it's one of the most iconic animals period. I mean if you, if you're listing\nthings that the average person has heard of: lion, elephant,\ngiraffe, tiger, hippo, rhino. There's a few more, but T.\nrex is coming somewhere up in that list. That, that's how\nprominent it is as an animal. So yeah, it's, it, it's\nalmost inescapable as a paleontologist. And then doubly so for me,\nwho works on dinosaurs, and doubly so again, 'cause I do work on tyrannosaurs. But\nyeah, it just dominates conversations. - Well, some of the other features,\nmaybe we can go through. - Yeah, sure. - So big skull, big head, small hands. - Massive head. Very kind of boxy.\nIt's very robust. Big forward-facing eyes. Massive eyes.\nMassive. I mean, tennis ball-sized eyes. These\nthings had amazing eyesight. Yeah. Giant teeth. There's a cast of a- - What? - ...Tyrannosaurus rex tooth. - What? - Yeah, I know. So- - How... - It, it looks a bit bigger than it is. So this is all root, so\nthis would be stuck in the jaw. This would be supporting it. - Right. But that tip part is- - But that- - ...that's the tooth? - The tip, as you call it. And, yeah, you know, so that would\ncomfortably go through pretty much any part. - Wow. - And then you realize just how thick\nit is. So this is a cast of a thing called Carcharodontosaurus\nfrom Africa. You get it down in Niger and a few other places like that. And they're very, very big. Not\nas big as T. rex, but not a million miles away. And then if you\nlook at the teeth in profile, they're a surprisingly similar shape\nand not far off in size as well. And then you look at them\nthat way on, and you realize it's a third of the width. So\nthis isn't just massive, it's thick. And of course, being\nthick, it makes it strong. And with that giant head, with all that extra\nbone and then all the extra musculature attached to that giant head,\nthey've got this uber-powerful bite and the ability to just chomp\nthrough basically anything it wants to. So yeah, they are truly unusual in that\nregard, even actually compared to a lot of the other very big tyrannosaurs,\nthey're often a kind of step above in their proportions. - So, incredible crushing power in the jaw? - Yeah. And then, as you say, like this really\nshort, bull neck, 'cause you've got this massive weight of this head up front\nthat you need to hold it up and not tip forwards. Really quite\na massive body. Again, there's two or three other big\ncarnivorous dinosaurs which people argue, oh, maybe they're a little bigger than\nT. rex, maybe they're a little smaller, but it's always in terms of length, which is one\nway of looking at things. You know, pythons are very long but they're nothing like as massive\nas, yeah, a lion or a tiger. Same thing. T. rex is massive.\nIt is built. So really big kind of barrel-shaped chest,\nmaking the body very, very big as well. And so that's why, yeah,\nthere's things like Giganotosaurus and Mapusaurus from South America. Maybe\nthey get a bit longer, another meter or so in length. But in\nmass, we're talking about maybe only two-thirds, three-quarters.\nSo T. rex is just massively bigger than basically any other\nbig carnivore we know of. And then, yeah, little arms, as you\nsay. So this is a, not great, but it's a cast of a T. rex arm.\nIt's not the biggest animal. They do get a bit bigger than this.\nBut as I love showing, it's not a million miles off the size of my own. And I could do with a diet, but\nI don't weigh seven tons. So yeah, it really is really pretty small. - Two claws, two fingers. - Yeah, so two fingers. You will see\nsometimes that they say there's a third. This is a slight misnomer. So you\ndo see this extra little bone here? This doesn't turn up in all of\nthem, and it's an extra hand bone. So it's these, the metacarpals. But\nit's not supporting an extra digit. - So mostly functionality-wise,\nit wasn't very functional. - They're not doing very much at\nall. This is what's called the deltopectoral crest. It's\nreally important for big arm movements because it's deltoids\nand pectorals. The radius and ulna are really quite thin, thinner than\nours. The fingers are pretty stocky. The claws look big and\ncurved, and they are, but other tyrannosaurs, and indeed\nother carnivores generally, have much more curved claws.\nAnd then they have these little things, oh, where can I say it? There,\nthere you can see there's a little mark. That's a ligamentous pit. And\nso what you can imagine is, if you're trying to hold onto something\nand something's wriggling, you want grip. And there's a risk that you'll just\ndislocate your fingers. So we have ligaments that hold bone to\nbone. And if you just put it flat to flat surface area, there's only so\nmuch you can attach. Whereas if you turn that into a little hemispherical dip, you\nget a lot more surface area for your area. If that makes sense. - Yeah. - So if you have a really big ligamentous pit,\nit means there's a really big ligament, which means your fingers are really strong\nand they're really resistant to being wiggled around and pulled, as if you've grabbed\nsomething that doesn't want you to kill it. Well, T. rex has probably the\nsmallest ligamentous pits of any tyrannosaur. So that kind of\nsuggests it's not doing very much. And again, when you look at the claws,\nproportionally, they're not that big and they're not that curved. So even\nthough it looks like quite a wicked thing to us, remember, put\nthis on a seven-ton animal whose individual teeth are\nthe size of entire fingers. Suddenly that arm doesn't look\nlike it's doing very much. - What about the feet? - So massive. Again, not\nsurprisingly, you're supporting a colossal amount of weight.\nBut they have this beautiful adaptation in the foot. So the\nequivalent bones in the foot, the metatarsals, for us make up the flat\nof the feet. But these animals walk like birds. They got three toes on the\nground and then the metatarsals stick nearly vertically. That overall extends the\nlength of the leg, so you can walk a little bit faster. You get a slightly\nbigger stride length. Don't worry, I've got the right bone here. - Nice. - But they also have... Yeah, there's a\ngood one. That one's a great one. But they also have this really neat\nadaptation in the middle bone. So you can see it on this one quite well,\nand that this is actually not a tyrannosaur, this is an\nornithomimosaur. So one of the really ostrich-like ones, Gallimimus from\nthe first Jurassic Park. It has the same thing. You can see the normal\nbones would be really quite long and square and then flat at the top. And\ninstead, this thing shrinks in the middle and turns into this kind of flattened\ndiamond shape. And what that means is... the bones either\nside kind of lock it. In fact, at the top end, it actually tends to\nwiggle a bit. So it actually goes left and then right. And of course, what that\nreally does is then help these things lock together. And so this is an\nadaptation to basically lock the foot and make it stable, and we\nsee it in a whole bunch of things, independently evolved. Early tyrannosaurs don't\nhave this. Early ornithomimosaurs don't have this. The oviraptodiraurs, the early\nones don't have this, and the later ones acquire it, and a couple of other groups\nas well. And it's about making the foot stable. And what that really\ndoes is make the foot energy efficient. So you can imagine,\nas an animal, you know, we have some cartilage and we've got some\nligaments and tendons joining all the bones together and holding joints\nstable. When you push down, that's going to compress them to a little degree,\nand when you lift that weight off, they're actually going to spring back. You're going\nto get a tiny little energy return. It's the idea of those air soles they\nput in all the trainers and stuff in the 90s. It's\nthat same principle. And you will. You'll get a little bit\nof energy return, but of course, big force, particularly for a big, heavy animal,\nit's going to take the path of least resistance. And so if your bones\nare all kind of loose in the foot, what they're going to do is they're going to\ntend to splay out, and you're actually going to lose that energy. But if you lock the\nfeet together, the bones can't move and instead, that's going\nto further compress those soft tissue bits and give\nyou a bit more spring. - And this is all about... I mean, this is\nabout the mobility, about the dynamics of the movement. - It makes you more efficient. It means\nyou're putting less energy in to walk, because you're just getting a little\nbit of spring of every single step. - I should say that I deeply admire people\nlike Russ Tedrake, like the Boston Dynamics teams, like the\nTesla Optimus robot teams that look at bipedal and\nquadruped robot movement. And they try to make human-like\nmovement to, you know, basically efficient movement. And so the\nquestion here is, how the hell is a T-Rex its size, bipedal, able to move\nas a predator? It's a weird body shape, is it not? - I mean, the big head makes\nit look more odd, but you look at dinosaurs as a whole, and over a\nthird, probably 40, 45% is the group called theropods, which were all bipeds,\nso T-Rex, Allosaurus, Velociraptor, Spinosaurus, many, many others that people\nmay have heard of, they're all bipeds built in this way. There's a whole bunch of\nancestral groups which were doing something very similar, including various crocodiles\nor relatives of crocodiles, and then the birds are bipeds. Birds\nare actually doing it in a much weirder way than theropods are. Theropods\nare basically a lizard on its back legs. I'm oversimplifying a lot. I can hear\npaleontologists screaming, as I've just said, \"It's a lizard standing up.\" It's not a lizard\nstanding up, but they're doing a lot of the same stuff in the same way, and that is\nreally functionally about where you put muscles, because what\nyou really want to do to walk forwards is you want to\nbasically pull the leg back so that you're pushing the body off. And the way they do that is the\nmusculature on the tail. We don't have a tail, and indeed, mammals that even do\nhave a, you know, elephants and even lions, it's a piddly little thing.\nThere's not a lot of muscle there. But if you look at a lizard, particularly if you\nlook at something like a crocodile, you see this massive, massive block of\nmuscle sitting on the first third to half of the tail.\nAnd that's what dinosaurs are doing. It's the same thing as lizards and\ncrocs. They have this giant set of muscles on the first half of the tail that's anchoring\non the femur, so the thigh bone, on the back of that, and muscles contract.\nThat's the one thing they do. But now you've got a giant\nmuscle. And T-Rex, this muscle is like two and a half, three meters long. It's going to be like this wide in\nthe middle. So when that contracts, the leg goes back, the foot's stationary\non the ground, so the animal goes forwards. - So the tail is... - integral to movement. - ...so it's a huge part of the\nbiomechanics of the movement. - Yeah, we do it with the butt.\nSo we're kind of weirdly how we organize our muscles. But this is generally probably a better way of doing\nit, because you can get a really long muscle. And of course, the longer the\nmuscle, the more contraction you can have. The hyper version of this is kangaroos.\nSo kangaroos supposedly get more efficient the faster they move.\nThey get so much energy return that when they're moving faster,\nthey get more compression from the landing, meaning they get more spring. - So we should be imagining this\ngigantic thick tail, big body, - Oh, yeah. - ...big head. - Yep. - ...and biped. And how fast does it move? - So this is one of those things that's gone\nbackwards and forwards and backwards and forwards. There was a paper arguing that we'd\nprobably been overestimating various speeds, primarily based on\nfootprints. There's been I don't know how many papers trying\nto do T-Rex speed. The most recent one that was pretty\ndetailed I think had it clocked at... So I think it was 25 miles\nan hour, so 40 kph was the very upper end of the estimate. So\nprobably a bit less than that. - Well, that means it can move. - Yeah, so that's the thing. Big things move quick. I've\nseen rhino and hippo going at full tilt, and yeah, they're\na lot quicker than you'd think. And at least part of it\nis simply stride length. When your legs are three-ish\nmeters long, it's hard not to cover a lot of ground with a single step. And yeah, big\ntheropods, T-rex is going to be a power walker. It's not\ngoing to run in the conventional biomechanical sense, where both\nfeet are off the ground at once. - So it's not running. It's power walking. - Yeah. But when you've got a\nfour or five meter long stride, it doesn't really matter\nwhether you're airborne or not. - Power walking, so you're\nnever... So, or running, there are moments in time when both\nfeet are off the ground, and you're saying likely here one foot\nis always on the ground. - Yeah, pretty much has to be for loading. - Oh, just because of the mass\nof the thing? Okay. All right. - You know, that's the origin of cinema? - What's that? - It's where... This is\nEadweard Muybridge. So the origin of cinema was a\nbet as to whether or not, while running, a horse had\nall four feet off the ground. And no one really knew this for sure.\nAnd a guy called Eadweard Muybridge, he was British, but he was living\nin the States. He was a keen photographer, and he basically\ndid what people have seen the Wachowskis do for The\nMatrix. He set up a whole row of cameras and set up a whole bunch of\ntriggers and had a horse run through them, so it took loads of photos. And\nlo and behold, in one of them, the feet were off the ground. The guy won his bet.\nBut he also realized that we already had things like zoopraxiscopes, you know, the\nlittle thing you spin with a slit? So you see the... Right. So he did\nthat with horses. And now you have a moving photograph. And that's pretty\nmuch the origin of cinema, was... a bet about biomechanics. - Yeah, it's always a good question\nand a bet, and there you go. You're off to the races. All right, all right, so we're\nstanding in front of this thing. - Yes. - How screwed are we, you and I?\nWe're back in the time of the dinosaurs. What's the\nprobability of our survival? - There's two big things to weigh up, which\nare going to be interesting, which is, would they even consider\nus a potential meal? Because we know that animals have never\nencountered things. Animals have to learn stuff. And so animals that have never\nencountered things before are often... They don't have a response because they\ndon't know what their response should be. - We should say during that time, there was\nnot something that looked like primates. - No. Absolutely nothing. We, we- - So we would look very weird, right? - We would look weird, yeah. So, you know,\nthere's lots of really cool records of, particularly you've got down\nin Indonesia and stuff, where you've got these insane volcanic\nspires, and it leads to these tiny little valleys. And people go in there, and they\ngo, \"Yeah, the animals walk up to us.\" They've never seen a human.\nThey don't know what it is. So it might look at us, and...\nAnimals are fundamentally cautious. It doesn't\nknow if we're a threat. So maybe it might just find\nus weird or in some way, shape or form off-putting,\nand so we may not even be considered on the menu. The other thing is we might be too small.\nMy suspicion is we're not. So animals, carnivores typically take stuff\nthat is much, much smaller than them, despite basically every\ndinosaur documentary movie ever shows T-rex hunting an adult\nTriceratops, which is, like, the same size as it. And every documentary, you gotta have\nlions taking down a wildebeest or even a buffalo. Like, these are weird\nand rare outcomes. These don't usually happen. The vast\nmajority of active predation is on stuff much, much, much smaller\nthan you. I totted some of this up for a paper I did on Microraptor, this\nreally small gliding dinosaur from China, where we actually have a bunch of\nspecimens with various stomach contents in them. And we were coming up with numbers of\nabout, like, 5 to 20% of the mass being typical, so prey versus\npredator. And that's actually very similar to what we see\nwith modern carnivores, and it's not far off what we've seen even with things\nlike tyrannosaurs, where you occasionally find consumed bones from prey. So, if we put the lower end of that as 5% of\nthe mass of a T-rex, we might actually be okay. If it doesn't consider\nus worth the hassle, then assuming you're encountering a\nbig adult and not a half-size one that maybe only weighs a ton,\nthen we might be all right. - What would be the survival strategy?\nSo there's a thing that you criticized as not being true that I, I guess\nin Jurassic Park, not moving. - Yeah, it's nonsense. They can see\nreally well. Like I said, like, T-rex has giant eyeballs.\nPeople don't realize that 'cause, like whales and like\nelephants, it looks small compared to the size of the animal, but what you're\nsaying. And really important for vision is absolute size, not proportional size.\nAnd absolutely, their eyes are gigantic. - Probably the biggest\non Earth at that time. - Yeah. A guy called Kent Stevens did\na paper, and he's got a really nice graphic of it. If you\njust put Stevens T-Rex, there, it's the one with\nthe... There we go. It's the one with the googly eyes.\nThat's a baseball or a tennis ball-sized eyeball. And\nwhen you think about the incredible visual acuity of something\nlike an eagle, which has eyes not much bigger than ours, think\nabout what that's going to do. And we absolutely know, there's\nbeen loads of studies on this in mammals and birds and\nother things as well. that basically eyeball size\ncorrelates with visual acuity. And that can fold in two\ndifferent ways. It can be like general sharpness. Like, how well\ncan you see a long way away? So eagles and vultures, it's really\nimportant. Or it can be good in low light. - And I now discover that there's a\nNature Was Metal- ...subreddit- - On Reddit, yeah, for- - ...which is looking at- - ...gnarly, gnarly paleo things.\nYeah, I come across it occasionally. - For dinosaurs, let's see what's\nthe top post of all time. - Oh, that's a glyptodontid. - An Argentinian farmer recently found a\n20,000-year-old fossilized glyptodont. - So these are giant armadillo-like\nanimals with club tails. - Interesting. Wow. - Oh, that's Black Beauty, and that's\nat the Royal Tyrrell Museum. So giant eyeballs, they can either see very well, they\ncan see a very long way in daylight, or they can see very well at night. And my suspicion\nis it's the latter. I think they're probably primarily nocturnal,\nwhen they get that size. - Well, not moving might be a good strategy because\nit's cautious because it doesn't understand what these- ...primates are. - Yeah. But I think if it\nstarts coming towards you, ...if you're truly in the open,\nthen you're in real trouble and I'm not sure what you do. I mean, the one thing, the one\nadvantage humans have over almost anything else on Earth, there's a\nhandful of exceptions, is we have range. I can pick up a rock\nand hurl it with reasonable accuracy. Most things can't do that, and animals probably don't like being hit in\nthe face or hit in the eyes with a rock at a range because, again, they're not\ngoing to know how it's happened or how to respond to this. All they know\nis they're taking damage- ...and that's bad. And that might\ngenuinely be enough to do it. I wouldn't want to try, but again, if I was dumped on a plain or a prairie with nothing\nelse but a T-rex that was interested in me, it's worth a shot. If you're in the forest, I would try and get behind\na tree. They're quite good at turning. There's been a couple of nice\npapers looking at the mechanics of the foot and the ankle and how\nquickly they could pivot. But we're much better because\nwe're just so much smaller. So it would be very kind of Looney Tunes, but I\nthink you could go round and round a big tree- ...yeah, but much\nfaster than it could. And so, ...it's going to get bored or\nlack interest sooner or later. - So let's zoom out. What did it eat? - I mean, you could go for the classic\njoke of whatever it wanted, but the reality is the relatively big\nherbivores that are around at the time, it's probably largely leaving\nthem alone because, again, just the classic dynamics of predators even like, quote, super predators,\nlike Tyrannosaurus, they're still real animals. If you get\ninjured and you can't hunt, that's probably the end of\nyou. So you don't want to tackle an adult Triceratops that\nweighs the same as you and has meter, a meter and a half\nlong horns on its head and it's potentially pretty\naggressive, and then even the big, so the Hadrosaurs, the kind of\nclassic duck-billed dinosaurs, they're not, they're not present with any like\nobvious defensives. They don't have armor. They don't have horns or spikes or anything\nlike this, but they're simply massive. Again, you know, yes, T-rex has\ngot the teeth and the bite and even if they're a bit rubbish with the claws\non the hands, but like just grappling another animal which is the same size as it, there's\na risk you're going to get a foot trodden on, that it's going to get off some kind of\nbody slam or whatever. And then even if you do bring it down, you're never\ngoing to eat it. Like if you, you bring down an animal that weighs\nfive tons, it's nearly your own mass. You're not going to eat it before it\ngoes rotten. That's a huge amount of kind of, not like wasted energy, but you've\nprobably put a lot of effort into this and you're not getting that much\nreward out. And again, there are, again, there are exceptions. You've got things\nlike lynx are the classic one. Lynx are not very big cats and yet\nthey'll hunt adult deer way bigger than them.\nLions hunt things like buffalo, but they're operating in a\ngroup, so it's a bit of a cheat. So there are some things that do this, but\nfundamentally, the vast majority of carnivores tackle stuff that's way, way smaller\nthan them, and that's what we see. Every record we have of\nbasically any large carnivorous dinosaur where you have stomach\ncontents, whether it's like consumed something or healed bite\nmarks, we get quite a, we get a quite a few. There's a handful of them\nwhere there's an obvious damage to a bone, in more than a couple of cases\nwith a tooth broken off in the bone, and then the bone has\nhealed over it, so you know, it got away. They're, they're juveniles.\nThey're relatively young animals. And that's what they're\ntargeting. It makes ecological sense. It's what modern\nanimals do for very good reason. Juveniles are relatively small and\nweak. They don't have the horns or frills or armor or shields and\nother stuff. They're naive. They don't, they have, you often have to\nlearn what predators are or you have to learn how to avoid them\nor to check the wind or even physically see them\nbefore you know, see them kill something else before you know that\nthey're a threat. And juveniles forage badly. They're relatively inefficient,\nso actually they need to eat more for their size than\nan adult does. And on top of that, they're not very experienced at\nforaging in the right areas. And even if they can find a good patch, the adults will\noften beat them up and chase them off. - You're talking about juveniles\nacross various species? - Everything. This is just a universal\npattern of being a smaller animal versus a larger, or a younger animal\nversus a larger animal. - So, so hunting young, uh- - Young things. - ... young things is easier. - Yeah because- - Because they're dumb. - Right. They're dumb, but\nthey're inexperienced. - Inexperienced. - But they're often feeding in\nsuboptimal areas. So this is the place with all the best food. The adults will\nkick you off, so now you have to feed somewhere else. Maybe the food isn't as good, in which\ncase you need to eat more of it, so it takes longer, or maybe it's the one next\nto the edge of the forest where the T-rexes hide. But either way,\nyou're stuck there and then you don't really know what you're looking for\nand you haven't got the armor, so guess who's getting eaten? Like this is, again, there's lots of exceptions. You\ncan't have nature without things like that. But this is the absolute rule\nof thumb for how foraging and growth and predation operate\nacross everything from fish to starfish, fish as\npredators, starfish, praying mantis, all the way up to things like\nbig cats via stuff like crocodiles. It's how it works, so it'd be\nvery weird if it didn't also operate for dinosaurs. And as I say, we've\nactually got the direct evidence for this from bite marks and stomach contents.\nThey're taking small stuff. - Bite marks give a lot of information.\nThat's a powerful signal in paleontology. - Yeah, absolutely. I've done really\nquite a lot of work on it and they can tell you an awful lot if you've got the right\nunderstanding of the burial conditions, because you, weird thing that I think\na lot of people don't appreciate is you basically can't take fossils at face\nvalue, particularly when you're trying to get into stuff like behavior and\necology. So between the animal dying and the paleontologist\ndigging it up, potentially quite a lot has happened,\nand that's where it's really easy to start misinterpreting\nthings because if you just go... I had one like this not too long ago where I\nwas an editor on a paper, and the authors had done a pretty good job, to be fair,\nbut it was this discussion of whether or not several animals were\ntogether at the time of their death. So multiple theropods together in this quarry, and it's like, right, but there\nwas loads of debris, and you had loads of things like fish scales and other\nsmall bones, and it's like, okay, but this looks like these animals\npotentially died somewhere else, and then a flood or\na river washed them into this bay or a channel or the water\nlevel dropped and they ended up together, but that doesn't necessarily\nmean they were together when they died. And so just 'cause you've\ngot three animals together, what is potentially the\nstory of how they got there? - So you have to consider multiple explanations\nand then try to figure out what is the most likely. - Yeah, or what can you test with various\nbits of evidence? So there were some tyrannosaur-inflicted\nbite marks on a duckbill from Mongolia that I worked on years ago. The specimen was from Mongolia, but it\nwas held in Japan in a Japanese museum. I was working with the Japanese on it. I'm not a taphonomist or the study of\ndecay and the history of specimens. I am in no way, shape, or form a\ngeologist. I did zoology for my degree, but the guys I was working\nwith, they were really hot on erosion and damage, and they\nwere looking at some of the way the bones had been damaged, and they're\nlike, \"Okay, we're pretty confident that the bite marks are sitting\non top of erosion.\" - What does that mean? - So it means that the animal had\ndied, and it was found in a it was found in sand-covered, but in what\nwould have been a river channel. So this animal has died, washed\ndownstream, ended up on a sandbank. The sand is whipping past\n'cause I've been in a sandstorm in- in China. It is not fun, and that's\nstarting to etch some of the bones and damage them. - And after that, there's a bite mark? - After that, you're getting\nbite marks coming in. So that - Oh, man. - can only be scavenging. That thing\nhas been dead and sitting out for days, possibly weeks, before something\ncame along and chewed on it. - Wow. - It pretty much can't have\nhappened any other way. - And you have to take these\nreally subtle signals to- - Yeah. - to reconstruct the story. - But then you can start piecing some\nother stuff together. So in this case, the skeleton is pristine.\nIt's one of the best hadrosaur skeletons out there. It's certainly\nthe best from Mongolia I've ever seen. And all the bite marks are on one\nbone, the humerus, the upper arm bone. Every mark- we went over the rest of the\nskeleton, nothing. And then the humerus is chewed to bits. There's bites\nall over it, but when you look, there are two really distinctive\npatterns. There are deep circular punctures. Remember what the shape\nof this thing looks like, at the ends. And then along the deltopectoral crest,\nokay, it's much, much bigger in a hadrosaur, but this bit, remember, that's where all the\nbig muscles attach. There are all of these types of- this is from a different bone, but a\ndifferent animal, but all these types of close parallel scratches. And so that looks like\nselective feeding because it's using its giant crunchy teeth at\nthe ends to get the bone off, and this is off a buried skeleton. then it's got these- actually, T. rex\nhas really small teeth at the front of its mouth, right in the front where\nour incisors are. They're called incisiform teeth. They look like\nincisors. They're a fraction of the size of the big ones, and they've\ngot a really weird flat back. And that's what these are. It's hidden this\nwith the front of the mouth and pulling. - And that's mostly for eating? - Yeah, and that's why it's just on the deltopectoral\ncrest, 'cause that's where all the muscles are. So I always liken it to getting\nsomething like an Oreo, and you take the top off and then you scrape\nthe cream out with your teeth. I think most people have done that. Right, but that's what it's doing. So\nit's got this little row of teeth- ...and everywhere you get lots of\nmuscle, you get little rows of teeth together, pulling. - So there's different bite marks for\nsorting, fighting, killing, and then there's different\nbite marks for eating. - Yeah, so it kills and dismembers\nwith the big teeth up the side- ...and then it feeds with\nthe little front teeth. - And all of that has\nevidence? In the bones? What hunting strategy does it\nuse? Can we figure that out? - So that comes down to that foot stuff. Um, they're relatively efficient\ncompared to a lot of other things. And particularly compared to the herbivores,\nso that means they're probably looking at long distance rather than speed, and that makes\nsense 'cause even though the kind of stuff we're talking about, like I said, maybe\nthey get into 20, 25 miles an hour. That's pretty quick, but some of the smaller\nstuff is going to be a lot faster than that. And remember, that's a real upper\nestimate. They're- they're probably not that quick, but yeah, almost- - They're just jogging after you. - Right, but they've got the distance,\nso yeah, so it's much more, uh- ...hyena or wolf-like strategy than like a cheetah going for hyperspeed or a\nlion going for a relatively quick burst, and it either gets you\nor it doesn't. And then people kind of then just go, \"Well, like, but that's ridiculous.\nLike, they're not even that quick,\" and it's like, yeah, but if you're hunting\nsomething big that's not that quick either, and so that's a misconception.\nLike when I'm talking about juvenile dinosaurs, I don't mean just\nout of the egg and weigh a kilo. Like a juvenile Triceratops\ncan still weigh a ton- ...and be the size of a rhino.\nThey're not that fast, and again, if you get a head start on them\nbecause, as I said, I suspect they're nocturnal. That's the other thing, it's\nreally hard to hide a T. rex, even lions and tigers struggle\nto kind of hide in long grass. When you're three and a\nhalf, four meters tall, you can't hide. Maybe in a forest, but even\nthen, you're probably going to stick out, and it's going to be hard to maneuver\nbetween the trees. We've got big tyrannosaurs living in what we know to have been relatively\nopen environments. Maybe there's some stands of trees, but it's not a\nwoodland or a forest or anything like that. So they're living in the open and\nsurviving in the open, so they've got to have a way of doing this. I think it's either some\ncombination of being nocturnal, so it's relatively easy to... \"sneak\"\nisn't quite the wrong word, but approach things to cut the\ndistance down for your initial strike and then just running\nthem down. Because, yeah, maybe a one-ton Triceratops or\none-ton Hadrosaur is rather faster than you, but if you've\ncovered the first couple of hundred meters to get up to your\ntop speed before they start running, then you're\nprobably much closer to them. Then will they exhaust\nfaster than you'll keep going? Probably not 100% of\nthe time. No predator's that effective. But I suspect that's what they're\ndoing, and it fits with what we know of their size, their vision. They have a\nvery good sense of smell. Again, that makes sense at night. It makes less sense\nif you're diurnal and operating primarily in the day. You've got to hide this\nthing, and then we know they're pretty efficient versus relatively\nfast but not that efficient prey. - Well, there's a bit of a debate\nof scavenger versus hunter. - They're obviously both. A, because we've\ngot things like the bite marks I just described, which is pretty much\ndefinitive scavenging. Then we've got the healed bite marks with T-rex teeth\nburied in bones, which is pretty much definitive active predation. So\nwe've got evidence of it doing both. - But can we possibly figure out\nwhat was the primary strategy? - That gets much harder. My guess\nis they're probably still primarily actively carnivorous.\nBecause if you look at stuff that's reliant on being a scavenger, I mean, the true\nscavengers, like the vultures and condors and stuff like this,\nyou have to be ultra-long distance, very energy-efficient\ntravelers. They're soaring in thermals. They're\nbarely using any energy to fly. It's really hard to get very far. - How far were they spread?\nWhere did they live? - So the ones we've found,\nyou've got them from Alberta down to probably New Mexico. There's some... I want to say there's\nsome tyrannosaurine, so very close to T-rex, teeth that\nmay or may not be T-rex in New Mexico. There are similar teeth\nin Mexico proper, down in Coahuila, so about halfway down Mexico. - Mongolia also, or no? - So Mongolia, you have a thing called Tarbosaurus,\nwhich is a very, very close relative of T-rex. It's the nearest species, or\nnearest genus, that we have. genus, that we have. But T-rex is probably occupying almost all of\nwestern North America. So at times, the east was kind\nof split off and separate. - But the entire surface of Earth had\ndinosaurs on it. Well, most of it. - Yeah, we've got them in Antarctica. We've got them in\nAntarctica even close to the mass extinction event. the mass extinction event. - Just an insane number of dinosaur\nspecies all over the Earth, just the same kind of variety we have in\nthe animal kingdom today, you just have in the dinosaur. - I mean, this is, like, how many\ndinosaur species were there? I- I mean, I basically wrote an entire\nbook chapter about this because there's so many. But this would make the\nnumber high, but this would make the number lower, this would make the number high,\nbut this would make the number lower, counter versus counterarguments, that you can guesstimate almost any number and\nprobably be very accurate or very far out. very accurate or very far out. - Yeah, but we should say that a large number\nof dinosaur species are constantly being discovered. - Yeah, so we've named, give\nor take, in the realm of 1,500, 1,600 valid species. Though that\nis, not everyone agrees on every species, not everyone agrees on every species, but most\npeople would be satisfied with that number. number. But we also name in the realm of 40 to 50 a\nyear, and we've been doing that for at least the last 10, 12 years.\nThat number is rocketing up. Shows no signs of slowing\ndown. There's loads of are- Like, we still never really explored India very much.\nWe're starting to find entirely new beds in places new beds in places like Ecuador. Argentina\nwe know has a ton of stuff, but we've never we know has a ton of stuff, but we've never\nexcavated there very much. Australia, we know there's a ton of stuff and we haven't\nexcavated there very much. So there's lots of places, even now,\nto still go through. - This is a good moment to take a brief tangent\nand look at paleontology. So how do we, how do we find these fossils? What's\nthe magic? What's the science? The art? the science? The art? - The same way, more or less,\nthat people did in the 1750s or whenever you first\nstart getting them. There's... There's... For dinosaurs in particular, but\nthis is true of the vast majority of stuff, there's essentially two ways of doing\nit. The simple one is where you have The simple one is where you have quarries of particularly things like lithographic\nlimestone, so the printing limestones, the printing limestones, or\nstuff that's very similar to that sometimes it's often volcanic you get these super, super, super fine layers of sedimentation.\nAnd that's where you get these places of exceptional get these places of exceptional preservation.\nWhenever you see, like, the feathers, or almost feathers, or almost always, whenever you\nsee feathered dinosaurs, it's like, \"Oh, we got the skin, we got the claws,\" and\nthe whole skeleton's laid out. So Archaeopteryx being the first bird\nis an absolute classic example. it's from these beds. And there you find them\nby basically splitting limestone. We don't splitting limestone. We don't usually\ndig for them. It's because there are quarry workers and people who are\nalready doing this because the stone is useful, because\nthere might be one decent fossil for every, you know, few hundred\ntons of rock you shift. In which case, you could get every paleontologist\nin the world there for a couple of years and you wouldn't find very much. You rely\non the fact that hundreds of guys are doing this constantly. And then sooner or later,\nthey'll find something, and then you've got it. That's the super easy way. The only\nslightly more complicated way is you go to somewhere where geologically we know\nit's the right age and it's the right kind of rock and ideally fossils\nhave been reported from there before. And again, you know,\ngeologists mapped all the world's geology years ago in quite a lot of\ndetail. There are gaps, there are places where we don't have the details,\nbut in general we know. And then you go there and then you walk around and\nyou look. And that's basically it. - And you're looking for something\nthat's sticking out of the rock. - Yeah. So you always get the... So there's this constant, and I think,\nyou know, borderline myth of the idea that dinosaurs\nand mammoths and lots of other fossil things, like, entered\nlots of indigenous cultures because it's impossible that\nthe guys were wandering around, say, Dakota, and the Native\nAmericans didn't come across some dinosaur fossils. That I'd agree\nwith. It's pretty much impossible they didn't come across some dinosaur\nfossils. Did they come across a whole skeleton laid out on the ground? No,\nbecause those don't usually exist because even if they're tougher, or it\ndoesn't matter if they're tougher or weaker than the surrounding rock, dinosaur bones are, you know, in some way, shape, or\nform, they're lithified. They turn to rock and they will absorb\nsome of the minerals from whatever they've been buried\nin. And so even in places like Mongolia and Northern China where\nI've been to, where actually the fossil bone is quite a lot tougher than\nthe sandstone that it's embedded in. You can find a bit of bone and pull it out,\nalmost like rub it with your hands and the sand comes off and there's your bone.\nThey will decay pretty quickly. You know, sandstorms, you know, sand\njust etches stuff. The tiniest bit of moisture, particularly in winter,\ngets into the cracks. Bones are incredibly porous. That freezes, that\nexpands, that cracks, bones just shatter. And yeah, you\nfind shattered bone on the surface everywhere. What\nyou rarely find is a decent bone on the surface,\nlet alone a skeleton. - So there has to be something that's\nsticking out just a tiny bit- - so that you can see it, but it's still\nburied. Right. And it happens. The greatest one that I saw, or\nthat I didn't see, it happened with a friend of mine when\nwe were in Northern China and he went, \"Yeah, I can see a bit of a\nclaw sticking out of a hill.\" And it was like this much. You could see you know, less than a centimeter\ncoming out of a hillside. And it's like, so you know, - That's the dream, right? - Dig a little bit, and there's a little bit more.\nDig a little bit, there's a little bit more. Okay. And then the system we were running there\nis some guys were searchers and some guys were diggers. So he and I were searchers.\nWe're told, \"Okay, you guys have...\" He found it. \"You found something, go and\nlook for something else. We'll dig it out.\" And so we come back a couple of days\nlater and check in on the digging team. \"So what is it then?\" \"Oh, it's a\ncomplete skeleton.\" And it was a thing, a very, very close relative\nof Velociraptor. Ended up naming it Linheraptor, so the raptor\nfrom Linher, which was the nearest town. And it was, yeah, the\nlegs were a little messed up because water had got to them and the end\nof the tail was missing and that was about it. So like 90-plus percent complete\nskeleton, and it had been found with, you know, five mil, a\ncouple of sixteenths of an inch of bone sticking out of a hill.\nAnd that's what you want, because every so often behind that is a whole skeleton.\nIf you're looking for skeletons on the surface, they're going to\nbe gone before you get to them. - And when it's a near-complete\nskeleton, you, you did a show of, Terrible lizards on Stan. - Oh, yeah. - the T-Rex fossil that\nsold for $31.8 million. - Sight and some of them. - So that, that's a nice sort of big adult\nT-Rex. So looking at a fossil like this... ...so for $31.8 million,\nwhat's the excavation process for when you have a claw sticking out,\nlike you were mentioning, and getting that whole thing out without damaging the bones?\nWhat can you say about that process? - So it depends where you are. It\ndepends how many people you've got. It depends on your budget and\nit really depends on the rock. So again, like going into China or\nMongolia, where this little guy's from, the bone tends to\nbe relatively strong compared to the sandstone\nthat it's in. That also, that means that, A, it's\nfairly tough and resistant, but it also means that it's really easy to dig. Like again, I've dug stuff by\nalmost like pulling it with my hands or like getting my fingers in. Getting\nsomething like a chisel or a hammer, you can just\ncruise through this rock. - But like, you have to be really careful\nnot to touch the bone, I guess? - So it depends how strong\nit is. So again, some bone is incredibly strong, some isn't\nbecause they've all fossilized differently. What we're usually\ndoing is applying glue to it though. There's this wonderful stuff called\nParaloid, and it's a special glue for fossils. And I said\nbone's super porous, so it's really good at sucking up liquids. - Oh, so you're basically filling it with\nglue so it like makes it stronger. - Yeah, and Paraloid's really great because\nyou can dissolve it with acetone, and it basically doesn't react with\nanything. So you can fill your fossil with glue, but then if you want to take all\nthat glue out, you can pretty much just dissolve the glue back out again. - Very cool. - So, yeah, what you would normally\ndo is for something, say in China, where the rock is relatively\nsoft and the bone's relatively tough, and where we don't have any, like, manpower and shipping problems,\nwhich is a real issue in other places, you basically map out\nwhere you think the skeleton's going. So in the same way that you were\ndoing it, like, you know, if you can imagine like a cake or something and someone\nsaid, \"Oh, put a toy dinosaur in there.\" And you've got to find it without damaging it.\nSort of like, well, you'd stick your finger in the cake and just kind of dig until you hit the edge\nof it and then you go in somewhere else and go in. And that's what we're doing. We're just going\nin from kind of all sides. And once you've hit three or four bones, you kind of\nknow which way it's going into the hillside, usually. Sometimes\nthey're very weird and mixed up. And then you can just almost\ntrace the outline of it. And then you'll just dig all the way\naround that, which might involve taking the top off a mountain,\ndepending on where you are. In the desert, it tends to be a bit\neasier. But yeah, we've had stuff where, like the first three days is just\nten people with pickaxes just digging a hole to get\ndown to the right level. - But sometimes the excavation requires\nlike large equipment, right? - Yeah, we've used jackhammers and stuff.\nWe've used a backhoe and we've just literally driven it into the desert\nand just dug a big hole next to the fossil. And then the classic\nthing of covering it in a plaster of Paris jacket.\nStrips of burlap sacking, plaster of Paris and some water,\nwooden beams if you want to make something really big\nand really solid, and just basically wrap it all up\nand then take it out. And that's, again, that's what\nthey were doing 150, 200 years ago, that hasn't changed.\nWhere it gets more complicated is if you've got\nreally hard rock that's very hard to get through, particularly if the bone\nis fragile. Then it becomes difficult because if you want to get a jackhammer\nin, the vibrations mean you're going to shatter your\nbones before you've even cut through the rock. So then you\nmight be down to doing it manually. - And manual is like- - Yep, hand-chipping it out. Yeah, the\nother way you end up with that is like the classic Jurassic\nPark thing, like, was it the second scene where they're digging in the\ndesert and there's the whole skeleton laid out and five or six guys all\ndigging around it and exposing it. And that's actually quite\ncommon in the States. And the reason is huge amounts of those\nexcavations are being done on government land, their national\nparks or whatever, or protected land. And very often the rules are, you're\nnot allowed wheeled vehicles, full stop, at all, to protect the environment.\nYou can walk in and walk out, but you can't drive. And it's like, well, when we're in\nthe desert in Mongolia or in China or Mongolia, and we're allowed to do this,\nliterally, yeah, my boss drove into town, hired a guy with a JCB. He drove out, picked it up with a bucket and drove\nit back into town and put it on the back of a flatbed and we drove it to\nBeijing. If you're out in a protected area and you can't,\nyou've got two choices. You can take it out by hand, but that\nmeans it's got to be light enough. that half a dozen people can lift it. Which if it's a block of stone the size of this\ndesk, you know, a couple of meters by a couple of meters by a meter high, is\nbasically impossible. So that means you've either gotta carve chunks\noff, so take the head off, take the arm off and whatever, and you can\nget it out that way, but it's not ideal. There's always the risk of\nbreaking, you're losing some information, and if you wanna make a really\nspectacular display, you don't wanna join through every big bit of bone. You\nwant to show the public one piece. So the alternative is to get\nrid of every bit of rock you possibly can to make it light\nenough to helicopter it out. - Wow. - And so normally... So in China,\nif we hit that bit of bone going in, we're just like going in\nround the sides until we've hit Take the top off, take the bottom\noff, and just take it so the skeleton is completely encased in rock\nand it's as safe and secure as it can be. And then we'll do the\npreparation work back at the lab. - That's heavy though. - But- - That's real heavy. - If you're going to have to lift it with a\nhelicopter and they've got a weight limit of only a couple of tons or if it's not,\nthen you need to pay twice as much more expensive helicopter,\nthen you take off every gram of rock that you think you can- ... to get the weight down so you\ncan ship it. So it, so it varies massively. Yeah. Something the size of\nStan, that's, that's months of work. You're, you're probably doing that across three\nor four years with a team of half a dozen people. - So can we just talk through? Because\njust using Stan as a case study, Stan was first discovered in the spring\nof 1987 by amateur paleontologist, Stan- Skekanson in Hell Creek Formation\nnear Buffalo, South Dakota. - Yeah. But it was the Larson brothers from\nthe Black Hills Institute who dug it up. And so they're, they're a commercial\noutfit, so they dig stuff up to sell it. But they also\nmake casts and sell them. This, oh, I brought my other... I do have\na cast, a cast of one of Stan's teeth. - Oh. - So like you can buy casts of Stan's\nteeth. You could buy casts of the head. you could buy the whole skeleton. - So it's a famous skeleton. - You see Stan in a whole bunch of different\nplaces. There's a Stan just up the road from here at Oxford.\nOxford's got a cast of Stan. - Oh. - I was just at Lyme Regis the famous\nfossil locality in the south of the UK a couple weeks ago. One of the fossil\nstores has a skull of Stan in the window. Stan turns up again and again and again. - So the process as written here\ninvolved removing the overlying rock. ...using heavy equipment like a Bobcat. - Yeah, so we call that the overburden,\nthe extra stuff that's all the rock that's sitting above\nthe layer with our fossil in. And when you're lucky, that's a foot of\nsandstone, and you shovel it out in an hour. And I've seen guys in South\nAmerica. There was a team in Argentina, I think it was my old\nboss, Ollie Rowhurst, showed me this. And they took like 20, 30 feet off\nthe top of a hill to get down to this fossil, you know.\nSomething, you know, it was probably half an acre in\nsize, 20, 30 feet of rock. - This is incredible. I wonder if you could speak to some of these other\ncomponents: Carefully extracting each fossil bone by hand with picks and brushes, plotting\nand diagramming the bones... ...using a grid system at the dig\nsite, wrapping the bones in burlap and plaster for safe transport to the\nBHI lab. Some of this stuff you've spoken to. What's with the diagramming?\nWhat's with the plotting and the diagramming? - So yeah, you may well have\nseen something like this for archeology shows or something\nlike that. Nowadays, again, tech's getting better; people are\nusing drones and stuff for this, or taking hundreds of photos and\nthen building photogrammetry models. You just get a 3D model in the computer. - Or just kind of modeling\nwhat we're looking at here. - Yeah, but where you found everything. So\nit goes back to that stuff we were saying about the process of fossilization or\nthe process of what's happened to that animal from death to discovery. A\nclassic thing is bones being in a line. So you can imagine if, you know,\nbones are lots of weird shapes, but mostly, or at least certainly\nlots of bones, ribs, arms, and legs, things like this,\nthey're quite long bones. So if they're in a current, they will\ntend to spin in the axis so that they are facing the current. So if you're\nfinding all the bones are in a line, that probably tells you that\nthis thing has had quite a lot of water washing over it. - Mm-hmm. Got it. - You're then probably going to be missing most of\nthe small bones because the big heavy bones won't be shifted by that current,\nbut maybe the small ones will. - Oh, so you actually model where the bones,\nwhere you're likely to find the bones, the big bones, the small bones... - So it might tell you where to go and\ndig further down the hill, quite literally, but it can also just tell\nyou, \"Okay, this thing, there's no way this thing died here.\nIt absolutely got moved, so we need to factor that in when\nwe're trying to interpret it.\" - Okay. - Or we've got this one weird bone and\nwe can't work out what on earth it is. Well, maybe it's from something else because\nif we know a whole bunch of stuff washed together, maybe that's a random\nbone from a different animal. - Yeah. Maybe that was eaten or there might\nbe a different story if it was washed like you were describing. - Any of that kind of thing. So that's\nwhere you want to have as much information as possible. - It says here, \"Once at the lab, the bones\nunderwent more than 30,000 hours of cleaning, preservation, restoration,\nand documentation.\" And, Stan's skeleton is notable for\nits high degree of completeness, about 70% by bulk, 63%\nby bone count, and the exceptional preservation of its skull, which\nhas become a scientific standard for the species. - Yeah. So there's this\nunbelievably beautiful skeleton, Borealopelta. This is a\nhelicopter lift. Absolutely. - It's awesome. - Phenomenal preservation from - What? - Northern Alberta. - What is this thing? - Its full name is Borealopelta\nmarkmitchelli, and it's called markmitchelli, named after Mark\nMitchell, the preparator, who basically spent, I think Mark spent\nthe thick end of two years on this. This was his job. And he did\nother stuff as well. He's doing some other prep, he's doing some\nfieldwork. But Mark basically went in every day, nine to five, cleaning\nthe rock because the rock was hard and the bone was soft, and it's\nextraordinarily well-preserved. - Borealopelta is a genus\nof plant-eating armored dinosaur. Sure as hell looks armored.\nThis is an incredibly preserved specimen. - Yeah. - from the early Cretaceous\nperiod, about 112 million years ago, found in what\nis now Alberta, Canada. Amazing. - Yeah. - Look at this thing. - So Borealopelta is one of the ones where\nwe've even got some of the evidence of patterning, and it suggests that it's\ndarker on top and lighter underneath. So this illustration, I think that's, yeah, that's\nJulius Chattoni did that. He's a Canadian paleo artist, and so that color\npattern is roughly accurate. - Oh, wow. So this is true to color. - Yeah. - And so we can figure out the colors that— - Well, give or take some\nvery large uncertainties— - Look at this thing. - it's going to be something like this. - That's so awesome. - Yeah. So these guys are— - That's hard to eat, that thing. - nearly armored pine cones.\nYeah. Though it's very much the adult condition. The juveniles seem\nto be far less, if not unarmored. - We're back to the juveniles thing. - Right. So, right, so— So, but that's why we... That armor\nis absolutely going to be effective as anti-predator, but it's\nprobably evolved primarily for combat and display between members\nof the species because otherwise if they stopped you being eaten,\nthe babies would have it. - This fossil is considered one of the\nbest- preserved dinosaur specimens ever found, with armor, skin,\nkeratin sheaths, and even stomach contents\nall intact. Incredible. And so for that, he really did the work. - And also found miles and miles\nand miles out to sea, or the, the paleo sea. So this is from a\nsite which normally gives us big marine reptiles. So predatory\nplesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs and and then mosasaurs and stuff like that. And then it turned up an Ankylosaur.\nWell, Nodosaur in this case. - Yeah. Wow. This is incredible. So, okay. Let's complete the\njourney of Stan to the museum to, like, you get, you get to the process of\ncleaning everything, stitching it all together. - Yeah. Like Mark suggested,\nyou know, this can be even with an animal that size. Borealopelta\nis, you know, four or five meters long. We've only gotten the front two-thirds\nof it. Yeah. This can be, like, needle-level stuff. - That's how you get to the 30,000 hours. - Yeah. Exactly that, if it's that\nquality and you want to get everything open. And then something like\nStan, actually really complicated skull. The skull's full of lots of\nlittle bones. The bones are really fragile. So that just adds to the time.\nI mean, at least with the Ankylosaurids, the skull is just this giant solid block\nof bone, which makes life a little bit easier. So yeah, they're going to put those\nhours in, and that's really going to help them sell the animal, which is ultimately what\nhappened. I mean, Stan sat in the Black Hills Institute for decades. I mean,\n'87, and they sold it in like 2020, so they had it for 30 years sitting in their kind\nof little museum. And then my understanding was basically the brothers\nbroke the company up and that's why they sold it. - Yeah. But it was still incredibly\nsurprising that it was sold for 31 million. - Yeah. I mean, far more than I think\nanyone thought it was going to. I mean, I, I liken... Well, you know, if you're\nnot buying, like, teeth or an ammonite in some small fossil shop, you know, when you're\ntalking about things like whole dinosaurs and whole tyrannosaurs, I think it's a bit\nlike the art market in it's worth what people will pay for\nit. And so, you know- ... plenty of T-rexes had sold for a few million\ndollars and therefore everyone thought it would, might be five. You\nknow, ten would be an absurd sum of money. And then\nyeah, it, it went for 30 and it's like, \"Okay, well...\nTwo.\" I was going to say, someone wanted it that bad, but clearly not two people\nwanted it that bad, because if only one guy is prepared to bid 30, then it goes for,\nyou know, a million more than the next highest bidder. But presumably,\ntwo people, if not three, bid it to get that high. - Yeah, it was anonymous at the time,\nbut now it's Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism came out\nthat they were the ones. - I know they've got it. - And that record has since been\nbeaten, apparently, by, uh... - by Apex, the Stegosaurus,\nwhich I still haven't seen, though a friend of mine has\nsent me some photos of this thing. - Is it impressive to you, this thing? - No, not especially. That's why I can't\nimagine that it sold for that much. It's a really nice Stegosaurus. It's\na pretty big Stegosaurus. - Well preserved. - I've seen other very good Stegosaurus,\nand I don't understand why that's worth that much more than something\nlike Stan. But it shows you the market. So, we're here in London. There's\na Stegosaurus called Sophie in the Natural History Museum in\nLondon. Sophie is a young animal, so she's not very big. I\nmean, it's a sizable specimen. I'd say five-ish, six meters, off the\ntop of my head, total length. But Sophie's truly exceptional.\nThere's a couple of plates missing, a handful of ribs,\na couple of bones in the tail. I think a couple of toe bones. This\nis, by far, the most complete stegosaurus out there. - Wow. - That sold for, I think,\n250,000 pounds, so maybe $400,000, about a decade ago. So\nthis has now gone up, like, 100-fold for an animal which is quite a bit\nbigger but is way less complete. So, for me, those two\nthings kind of balance out because size is always impressive, and that's\nwhat the public likes, but also a complete one is better than a half a one or\ntwo-thirds of one. So yeah. So how has the price gone up 100 times, or from\n400,000 to 40,000,000 in 10 years for roughly the same thing? - A T-rex is a little bit more epic than - Well, that's the thing. - a Stegosaurus. - T-rex has a massive premium on it, because it's, yeah, a\nStegosaurus is one of those top-tier, you know, it's...\nYou can virtually do the list. You know, T-rex, Triceratops, Diplodocus,\nBrontosaurus, Stegosaurus. It's in that first six or seven. Okay,\nthese days, Velociraptor, thanks to Jurassic Park. But it's...\nRight, there's the list of seven or eight things that any random human who doesn't care about dinosaurs and doesn't know anything\nabout dinosaurs, but they've probably heard of them. You know, Stegosaurus is in that list and\nwould have an idea of what it looked like. Oh yeah, it's got like the big stuff stuck\nalong the back. You'd get that answer from almost any, you know,\n99% of people on the street. But yeah, it's not a T-rex.\nSo how it's worth, yeah, 50% more So how is it worth 50% more, and it's not\neven a particularly complete skeleton, to my understanding? I don't get it. - Actually, since we're on the topic\nof money, if I gave you, let's say, $10 billion, how would you\nspend it? I'd force you to spend it on dinosaur-related things.\nHow would you spend it? - I mean, I'd probably drop half a billion\nor so on the best museum you'd ever seen. - So, put together a museum. You're\nlike one of the great communicators. One of the great scientists, and so you\nwould want to push forward the whole field. - Yeah. - And one of the ways to do that\nis a great museum, actually. - Yeah, but you want to...\nSo it's twofold because, yeah, there's the communication and the education\npart of it, which is something I'm massive on, and I think research is pointless\nif you don't communicate it at some level. I'm not saying everyone needs to\ncommunicate everything. If you're working on the nuances of a calculation of the\nvolume of a black hole or something, yeah, it probably doesn't need a press\nrelease or a new museum exhibition. But fundamentally, we should be talking\nabout our work. But also, you've got to store this stuff. Many fossils\nare fragile. They need to be kept not necessarily in climate control,\nbut at least you want a basement that is much more even than, you know, just sticking it in a box in a warehouse\nsomewhere. So you've got to be able to store this stuff to be able to study\nit, or it's kind of pointless. But with the rest of that money,\nI'd buy a ton of land, like the quarries that gave us Archaeopteryx\nin Bavaria and have given us a ton of other stuff. I've worked on a load of\npterosaurs, the flying reptiles from there. These stuff are mostly commercially run or just straight-up\nprivately owned and not being commercially run. Someone's just inherited\nit, and is just sitting on this stuff. - So if somebody's building stuff on land,\ndoes that threaten the possibility of discovering something on it? - It's more that they're not necessarily\nexploiting it with fossils in mind. - Presume you have to balance the\nsearch efforts and then the land by- - Yeah, but you know, one\nbillion on its own would go a very, very long way, almost infinitely,\nif you're just creaming off the interest and then funding excavations\nand supporting scientists who are already embedded in other\nmuseums or other universities or other research institutes. - So the rest is for buying up land so\nthat those people can do their work. - Yeah, you look at somewhere like, you know, Brazil,\nand there's... I can never remember the name of it, but there's, again, one of these\nzones of exceptional preservation where superlative pterosaurs,\nfish... We've had a handful of dinosaurs and a whole bunch of other\nstuff has come out, and it's just a giant commercial mining operation. And\nyeah, when they hit a fossil when they think they're close to it, yeah, they\nstop and pull it out and they'll send it to a museum, and more often they'll sell it\nto a museum, and museums only have so much money. Whereas what if I owned that quarry and then I made sure everyone who worked\nthere was trained and got a bonus every time they found anything and then\nI just handed everything they dug up straight into a museum? - So there would be some element of\na crowdsourced paleontology or... - Yeah, but it's more that like\nno researcher ever needs to... spend money to access that. No\nmuseum needs to go and find a new donor to give them half a\nmillion to go and buy this one specimen, knowing that it might\nstill go, yeah, to some Silicon Valley billionaire's foyer or whatever.\nIt's like, \"Well I own the land, so it's mine, so problem solved.\"\nLike, that's what's in my head. - It just would be wonderful to scale\nup the effort to where we can map out the whole, sort of, story of this\ntime, because it's such a fascinating time in the history of Earth. - I've jokingly written a\ncouple of times about how all science funding in the\nworld should go to paleontology. And the idea being that, like,\nif you want to investigate black holes or neutrinos or\nchemical crystallography or panda genetics or whatever\nit is, you can do that any time you want. That's not gonna change a million years from\nnow as it will from tomorrow. But fossils are in places that\nerode, and if we don't dig them up, they're gone. So we should dig all the fossils up now and then we've\ngot forever to study them. But if we don't dig them up now, who\nknows, maybe there's something twice the size of T-Rex and it sat on a hillside\nfor six months and then the wind got to it and it's gone and that was\nthe only one that ever preserved. Well, we'll never know now. To\nbe clear, this is a joke. I'm not suggesting we should stop doing\ncancer research and physics and other things, but it is, we're in a\nfundamentally different field where our science is\nliterally disappearing. - Yeah. I mean, I know it's a joke,\nbut there's some truth to it. And, on the flip side, one\nof the things, one of the hopes is that technology will\nsomehow ease the search and discovery process, but as you said,\nso far most of it... - It hasn't. Yeah, I mean... - So far. - Yeah. You know, Jurassic Park '93, you've\ngot that little scene where they've got the, like, thumper or something they\ncall it, and it hits the ground and seismic, and then they go, \"Look,\nlook! Here's the whole skeleton.\" They tried\nit. It doesn't really work. We've tried looking for stuff with drones. That helps you getting\ninto some inaccessible areas, but until the\nresolution is probably better, you've still got that problem of,\nlike, looking, you know, with human eyes which are binocular, and\nbeing able to, you know, just tilt your head completely changes how you\nsee something in a way that flying over just won't. I know they've tried looking... So because the bones\nare porous, they tend to suck things up, so actually dinosaur bones can be\nreally radioactive if they're in areas where there are things like uranium. So yeah, there\nare drawers which have lead boxes around them and stuff like this for dinosaur\nbones, or just signs saying, \"Do not handle.\" They're very\nlow-level radioactive. Like, you'd have to stick it in your pocket\nfor six months to run any real risk. But they're radioactive, much more\nso than the background. So can we do that? Hmm, turns out, not really.\nSo again, maybe tech will advance. - But for now- - Right, and- - ... humans are quite incredible. - Yeah, we are. But also, paleo's\nkind of at the bottom of the pile, you know. There's not many of\nus. We don't have a lot of funding. It takes real money to adapt stuff. So,\nyou know, like, we're scanning stuff with MRIs and things like that in\nhospitals, but it mostly doesn't work very well because the problem\nyou've got is, like I said, the bones take on some of the properties of the minerals in which they're\nembedded, which means their density is really similar,\nand things like MRIs or seismic activity is basically looking for\ndifferences in density. What if it's the same density as the- you know, it's like\nI put some green plasticine in some blue plasticine, there's gonna be a bit\nof a join and they're gonna be very, very slightly different. But ultimately,\nyou're not gonna be able to detect that through most means if you're looking\nfor density or mass or anything like that. - Well, I personally think that\nthere's few things as important to understand as the history\nof life on Earth. There's like books, right? There's like a- or maybe you could think of it as chapters, and\nthen one of the chapters is the time of the dinosaurs- and then there's a great\nextinction, so it just goes up and up. - I mean, that's not a million miles off.\nI think Darwin had an analogy like that of we've got a few\nwords on a few pages spread out, but between them\nyou get an idea of what the story is and where it's going. - I think what humans don't\nquite realize is we may end up being just a chapter in\na book. It might be our extinction event, self-created,\nperhaps a nuclear war, perhaps robots take over,\nperhaps we don't know. - Well, or dumb luck. I mean, the dinosaurs\nwere doing absolutely fine until a dirty great rock hit them and you can't, you know, Ben Affleck and\nBruce Willis movies aside, there's only so much you can do about that. - Hey, you take that back. There's nothing they can do wrong. All\nright. Quick pause. Bathroom break? We've taken a few tangents, but let's\ncontinue on the thread of T-Rex. Go to the skull. So the skull of\nT-Rex is iconic. You describe it as being incredibly robust and overbuilt. - Yeah. There's a lot of bone on there.\nSo we mentioned a couple of other things, like Giganotosaurus, is this,\nyou know, giant carnivore. If you put Giganotosaurus T-Rex in- That's the one.\nSo that's, yeah, that's from my old blog. It's not my image. Um... - What are we looking at, on\nthe left and the right? - So you've got T-Rex on the left, in orange,\nand Giganotosaurus on the right, in red. As I said, they're pretty similarly\nsized, but just look at the robusticity. Like, the front\nof the snout of T-Rex is all bone. And yet, the major openings, there's\na thing called the antorbital fenestra, the opening in front of the orbit, is\nabsolutely massive in Giganotosaurus. It's like half the skull. The opening at\nthe back of the skull is much bigger. The opening in the lower jaw\nis much bigger. And actually, the jaw, what you can't see, side\nto side, is much thinner. So their heads are the same size, and\nas animals, they are about the same linear dimensions. But you\ncan just see, there's just way more bone in the T-Rex. - It's incredible. - So it's not overbuilt; it's\nobviously evolved that this is the right amount of bone for the stresses and\nstrains, for what it's doing and how it's acting. But you compare it to anything\nthat's not a very large tyrannosaur, and suddenly\nyou see just how much bone has gone into it. It is a very\nlarge... It's an absolutely large head, but it's a very heavy head\nwith a lot of bone. And a lot of that bone is there to resist all the forces of all\nthe muscles, because it has this giant, super-powerful bite. Which\nagain, you can see in the teeth. - So the bone and the muscles\nkind of evolve together... - Yeah, yeah. - ...to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. So\nyou need this kind of structure for the power that, ...the crush has. - So one of the big things tyrannosaurs\nhave... And this goes all the way down to the earliest tyrannosaurs\nwere like our size. Like little diddy things, like two, three meters\nlong, be a meter and a half tall. But they have fused nasals.\nSo the pair of bones that, in us there's not a lot there, but obviously in something\nlike a dog or something like a baboon with a long nose, it's like the whole top of the\nsnout. And there's two, one each side. In tyrannosaurs, they fuse together,\nso it forms a solid bit of bone. So the whole top of the nose\nis solid. And then that makes the skull just fundamentally\nmore rigid and able to take more power through it. The very early\nones weren't super biters, I suspect, but they do also have the little\nflattened teeth at the front, so I strongly suspect the fused\nnasals, at least originally, is for resisting that. If you've got a long\nnose and you're pulling with quite a lot of force at the very tip, that's going to\nbend your snout. So, strengthen that. - Can you speak to the evolution from\nthe smaller to the bigger of the T-Rex? What were some of the\nevolutionary pressures? What's the story of the evolution? - So tyrannosaurs go back to the Middle\nJurassic. Tyrannosaurs were around for a hundred million years,\nso from about 160-ish, 165-ish million years till\nthe extinction, 66.5 I think is the current dating on that. So\nyeah, you've got a hundred million years of them. And the Middle Jurassic,\nannoyingly, is probably the bit of the Mesozoic, so the whole dinosaur\nperiod, that we know the least of. Just by chance, we just don't have many\nrocks exposed of the right age that are fossil-bearing. But we've got\ntwo or three tyrannosaurs from that time. And yeah, they're\nreally quite diddy. They'd be chest-high to us, two or three\nmeters long, including the tail. Probably more like three,\na lot of them. Little heads, long arms. They look every other carnivore going. There's\nnot a lot special to them, at this point. They've only\njust separated from their nearest groups, which is actually something\nlike the ancestors of Giganotosaurus, actually. They do have the\nfused nasals early on. They do have these special little teeth at the\nfront of the jaw very early on. They're feathered early on, definitively. We have skeletons with feathers on them\nthat are early tyrannosaurs, at least until the Early Cretaceous. But yeah, they're knocking around as\nrelatively small animals in Europe and Asia. We have a couple from the UK. We have a\nwhole bunch from China. There's stuff from like Kyrgyzstan and places like this. I think\nthere's one, a relatively early one from Russia. And then when they get into the Early Cretaceous, they start getting\nquite a bit bigger. So someone like Yutyrannus, if you want to...\nThere you go. So Yutyrannus is fuzzy. We have three specimens\ndefinitively feathered. It gets to six, seven meters long. - There's something funny-looking about the\nsexy, smaller, earlier version of the T-Rex. - But again, this is seven, eight\nmeters, maybe weighs half a ton or a ton. Like, we are very much on\nthe menu for an animal that size. And it's massive and dangerous.\nQuite what triggered them... There are general patterns in\nevolution of size change, and one famous one called Cope's Rule, I've worked on a fair bit,\nwhich is the idea that over time, things tend to get bigger, and they do for\nvarious different reasons, one of which is just pure, almost, like,\ndiffusion. If you start small and you evolve, well, you can't get much\nsmaller, but you can always get bigger. So you'll naturally kind of\ndiffuse away. Whereas if you're a blue whale, you probably can't get much bigger,\nand its descendants will probably end up being smaller. But there are reasons\nthat bigger things do better. You can hunt more stuff. You are more\nenergy-efficient. You can move more efficiently. You're dominant in contests, particularly with conspecifics. If you're\ntrying to win a territory or win mating rights, bigger things usually beat up\nsmaller things. So there's going to be selection favoring them. But then\nbig things don't usually do well in extinction events, so that tends to reset\nthe clock by killing off the big stuff, and then smaller stuff does better again. - So mostly, there's\nevolutionary advantages, but- - But a fairly big one. So yeah, it's\nthe classic thing of there's a day-to-day advantage of being bigger,\nand that might last for a few million years, right up to the point that suddenly there's\nthe biggest drought the Earth has encountered in five million years, and then all\nthe big stuff just gets nailed. - Oh, so we should probably say, is this accurate\nto say that the bigger you get, the fewer of you there are? - There are, yeah. There's just less\nfundamental space, you know? There's more mice than there are elephants.\nThere are more elephants than there are whales. Like, there is only so much\nbiomass that an ecosystem can support. - And bigger things are just worse at\nrepopulating in extinction events- - Right, so they're less likely to survive\nbecause they need more fuel. You know, what would feed a mouse for a year\nwon't feed an elephant for a week. So if... And, of course, the mice are going\nto have an easier time finding a few little seeds than an elephant's going to\nfind tons of food, and then they've got less genetic diversity. There might be\n5,000 mice, there might be 200 elephants, so who's likely to\nhave more genes or who's likely to have selection acting on\nthose genes to produce a survivor? Well, the one with five\nor ten or a thousand times the population. And then, on top of\nthat, you've then got the very slow reproductive cycle which then,\nagain, gives evolution not a lot to work with if, as an elephant,\nyou're breeding once every five years, and as a mouse you're\ndoing it once every eight weeks. - What can we say about the evolution of\njust the massive bone-crushing power of- - So that starts kicking in seriously,\nkind of Eotyrannosaurus up. So that's when you start getting not just\nbigger animals that are getting to a comparable size to the other big dinosaur\ncarnivores of the time, you start getting those bigger heads. But even then, relatively late in tyrannosaur evolution,\nso getting into the middle part of the Late Cretaceous, you see a split\nand we have a group called the Alioraminous which have\nreally, really long, thin skulls and they look much more like\na kind of, here's a Velociraptor, they look much more like a\ngiant Velociraptor-ish than a tyrannosaur. Still\nrelatively small arms but it's a very long snout. And so this\nis a fast-biting animal with a relatively light bite, so it's probably\ntaking really quite small stuff proportionally. And then the\nother side you've got the tyrannosaurines which are\nthe really big-headed ones. And so that is few ancestral\nthings like Albertosaurus and Gorgosaurus, both from Alberta, but then Daspletosaurus, a thing I named\ncalled Jiuchengtyrannos in China, and then Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus. And\nyou've really only got three or four of these ultra-giants, which\nare all kind of 10 meters plus in size and then have the really broad\nskull with a real kind of excessive bite force. But even things\nlike Albertosaurus, which is, I mean, a big animal, seven,\neight meters, yeah, a ton or so. They're not quite T-rex but\nthey're definitely more robust than the other contemporaneous\ncarnivores. So there is this progression of\ngetting bigger, getting a bigger head, the teeth get bigger\nbut there's fewer of them, building up the bone\nbiting and the power. But with some interesting evolutionary\noffshoots, in the way that, yeah, cats are largely much of a muchness but then you\nget things like, well, like bobcats and lynx which are actually quite bulky, stocky little cats that don't\nhave the long tail and are doing something quite different. - Can you just speak almost more\ngenerally? Because T-rex is sort of one of the great\napex predators of history on Earth. How does an apex\npredator evolve? Why did T-rex win? Why isn't everybody, why isn't\nthere, like, a vicious race to the top and everyone's- - I have a problem with the\nterm apex predator because ecologically, apex predators are generally\ndefined as things that eat other predators. So a great white\nshark is because it's eating stuff like tuna and sea\nlions which are themselves predators, so it's a predator\nof predators. Whereas people love saying lions are apex predators\nand they love saying T-rex is an apex predator. They're eating herbivores. This\nis not some weird and unusual thing. They're the largest predator in their ecosystem and they are a giant\none. My friend, Darren Naish, has moved to using the word arch\npredator, so it's like some kind of massive thing but avoiding the\nterm apex because I think that leads into a... It's a subtle\nterminology thing, but like- - An important one. I just learned something\nnew today. I didn't understand, I thought I was using the word apex predator\nas meant that, but that's what - But that's because everyone keeps using\nit when I don't think they should. - All right. - And now you're getting into linguistics and it's\nlike, well, if everyone uses it to mean that, does it now mean that rather than what it should\nmean? And then I'm probably losing that argument because actually you'll probably find way more\nstuff calling it an apex predator than you will an arch predator, but here we are. - Arch predator, beautiful.\nI learned something today. - It's- - But that you're saying T-rex\ndidn't eat other predators? - Well, it's probably not\ngoing to. So we can get into, though I'd prefer not to 'cause it's\ntedious, the argument of whether or not there's these small things which some people have said\nis a different group called Nanotyrannus, or a different species called\nNanotyrannus. But fundamentally, T-rex is definitely weird,\neven compared to all the other giant tyrannosaurs that are\nvery closely related to it, because it is by far, ludicrously by far,\nthe largest carnivore in its ecosystem. So- - So it doesn't really have\ncompetition actually? - I mean, so this is a Velociraptor skull. There are some carnivores that\nare a bit bigger than this, but not enormously so,\nwhich we're knocking around as T-rex. The\nskull's the same type- tooth. Right, but, like,\nyou think about that. And that's like going, that's\nlike going to Africa and going, \"Okay, there are lions.\nWhat's the next biggest predator?\" And it's like, well,\nthere's a weasel about this big. Like, it's that kind\nof size difference and you don't get that normally in ecosystems. - So it didn't have some of the\nother big dinosaurs around it? - Not carnivores. There's huge herbivores. - Oh, there- - But there's no huge carnivores around. - Oh, I see. It would eat those\njuvenile herbivores, but not- - Oh, yeah. It's gonna be eating Triceratops\nand Edmontosaurus and Parasaurolophus. There's even a couple of giant sauropods\nknocking around in some places. - Got it. - It's gonna be hoovering them up,\nbut, like, how often is it gonna eat... Again, Velociraptor isn't there, but how\noften is it gonna eat something the size of an adult Velociraptor? I mean, they're a fraction of our size\nand we're probably too small. That, that, this is like lions hunting mice.\nLike, you're just not gonna unless one virtually runs into your mouth,\nyou're not gonna go and try and eat it. - So the question still stands about\narch predators then, like how does it, how do you win in evolution? - Yeah. Well, I mean, so\nI mean, there's no real winners, there's just, you know, turnover\nbecause ultimately the birds, you know, it, it's still lost out when things went wrong.\nAnd as we were just talking about, you know, things do tend to lose out when\nthey're big. They're just so much more vulnerable to extinction. But\nclearly, dinosaurian ecosystems had much bigger herbivores,\nand therefore by extent, much bigger carnivores than\nany system we've seen before or after. Even in relatively sparse ones like bits of the late Triassic,\nso when the dinosaurs were really just getting going, or the very early\nJurassic, but you've still got some like multi-ton herbivores\nand then you've got some multiple 100-kilo\npredators, so about as big as elephants and\nlions get today. And then once you're in the Jurassic and\nCretaceous, it is entirely normal to have multiple species that are\n10, 20, 30 tons plus as herbivores and anything up to\nfive tons as a carnivore. I mean, T-Rex is probably the biggest of them,\nbut carnivores that exceed terrestrial- fully terrestrial carnivores\nthat exceed a ton, there's dozens of species of dinosaurs. - Is it interesting to you\nthat no other carnivore predator was able to develop in that\nenvironment over millions of years? - I mean, they're probably just ecologically\ndominant in the way that mammals are now, you know. Crocs get\nbigger than lions and tigers, but they're fundamentally tied to the\nwater. But you don't see crocs roaming the Serengeti or anything like that. But yeah, big, I mean the really big\ncrocs even now get to over a ton, so those are very serious\nanimals. And I think big polar bears are in the, like, 500 kilo range, though\nagain, they hunt a lot of stuff in water. And then things like grizzlies are at\nleast partially herbivorous or omnivorous. - Well, so there was a very\nlarge marine reptile, Mosasaurus. Did T-Rex\never come across that? - In theory, at least, the\nreally giant Mosasaurs are much bigger, in the same way that\nunsurprisingly whales are much bigger than terrestrial carnivores\nnow. Um, Jurassic Park unsurprisingly has rather exaggerated it\nso the one from I think Jurassic World is like twice the size it should be.\nBut some of these things were still, like, you know, 15, 20 meters. But\nyeah, some of them are absolutely giant. We, we had one dug up in the UK\njust a couple of years ago and I got to see the skull of it, or a cast of\nthe skull, and yeah, it's about the same size as a T-Rex skull. - If we take a ridiculous\ndetour before we get back to science, what creature in\nthe history of Earth would challenge a T-Rex in a\nfight, would you say? What- - On, on land? - On land. - I mean, nothing reasonable. The\nreally big ones are gonna be... The only other thing you can really\nadd is, so, this might be a very British adage of it's not the size of the\ndog in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the dog. So yeah, maybe\nthere's something a bit smaller which is just hyper-aggressive and that\nwould be enough to win. Like, the classic honey badgers chasing off lions. It's not\nthat a honey badger would win in a fight, but if the honey badger is prepared to put up that much\nof a fight and the lion really doesn't want to get hurt, then, then he kind\nof technically wins. - You can't imagine, like, any of the\ncats? Like, tigers, none of them... can do, I mean, the size difference, the\npower of the jaw, all of that kind of stuff. - Yeah, but going to T-Rex, like,\nwhat could reasonably challenge it? There's a couple of other giant tyrannosaurs,\nthere's a couple of giant Carcharodontosaurs from South America that I would\nsay are comparable in linear measurements, but are probably\nrather smaller and rather lighter. In which case, your money is\ngonna be on the bigger guy with the bigger bite. And that simply is T-Rex. - And the bite is important. - Yeah, I think it is,\nbecause, yeah, these guys, the Carcharodontosaurs,\nthey're much more cutting. And they're really\nkilling stuff probably by grappling with the arms, because they do\nhave big, muscular arms with big claws. And then slashing away at stuff.\nSo I think they're probably doing something more like almost like\nwolves or hyenas or a hunting... dog, where they're harrying\nstuff and slashing at it and you're basically bleeding\nthem out. ...And wearing them down. - So what about that strategy? So\nmaybe you could speak to biting strategy. So a T-Rex is a, I guess, a relatively slow bite\nbut extremely powerful. What about animals that have very fast bites? - So it's very simple mechanics,\nyou know. If you have a very long jaw, you're going to close faster but\nwith less power at the tip than if you have a really short one that's\ndeep. And so that really is it. But yeah, let's say there are\nthings like the Aramins and then there are things like, you know, Velociraptor and\na lot of its relatives, really very small but, you know, narrow. It is\nnarrow-snouted. There's not going to be a lot of fundamental strength here. The\nteeth, very numerous, very small so they're much more about grabbing something tiny, you know.\nVelociraptors eating rat-sized stuff, that's going to be\nprobably its primary diet or- - So I wonder if there's a bunch- - ...kind of diet. - ...of smaller, fast-biting things that\ncould just bleed a T-Rex to death. - They're going to struggle though.\nI remember doing some work for one documentary and they literally\nwanted Velociraptor fighting a T-Rex and I was sort of like, \"You\ndo know this is, like-\" \"...we're going to shoot some meerkats killing\na lion.\" And it's like, well, you can film it but no one would believe it\nbecause, you know, these ankle-high things trying\nto, like, savage a shin bone are, yeah, I'm sure they'll\nmake some holes and it'll lose some blood and it may not be very happy but\nI don't think they're going to win. - The size of a Velociraptor was\nexaggerated by Jurassic Park. - Oh, enormously. I mean, they\nget a bit bigger than this. ...in terms of the skull. But\nyeah, they're kind of thigh-high, to me, like a meter or so\nto the top of the head, two meters long, whereas in the\nmovies, they're, like, standing taller than guys who are\nsix feet. So it's just massively, massively scaled up, and then\nthese kind of big, domey heads, and they're not the really long, narrow snout. - Maybe we could take that, change it. What\ndoes Jurassic Park and Jurassic World franchise get right and wrong? - I mean, they get wrong a hell of a lot. - What are some of the really definitive\nthings to you that are interesting that it gets wrong, and also what are the\nthings it gets pretty close to right? - I mean, I just want to preface my\nanswer 'cause I always get asked about this, understandably.\nIt's like, I get that it's a movie. But if someone's going to\nask me, \"What does it get wrong?\" I'm going to give them an answer. But I do get\npeople going, \"Ah, you're just nitpicking.\" \"Ah, you know it's fiction. Ah, you\nknow it's made up.\" Yeah, I do know. But someone asked the question,\nso here's the answer. - I should say that some of the\nthings that I've heard you describe, I feel like it's the\nresponsibility of those folks to get it right. I think there's something I really deeply admire. There's a\nshow called Chernobyl. It's like they don't need\nto be that accurate, but they really... the\ndetail of the kitchenware- in a room, just to get the\ntiniest detail right. Who's that for? I don't know who that's\nfor, but that's for great art. That's for the spirit of\nthe thing. And if you focus on getting those tiny\ndetails right, some magical thing happens about the bigger story. If you\ndon't care about the details, it... the story gets corrupted. So I just wanted\nto say that some of the things you describe, like how many fingers- it's important to get that right 'cause if\nyou do, some magical stuff can really emerge. And it could become a legendary\nfilm as opposed to just a- - Yeah, I mean, that- - a summer hit. - that's my take. Again, I've worked\non documentaries where they're claiming that accuracy is absolutely\ncritical and 100% important, and they won't put anything on screen\nthat I haven't told them to, and- then many of those things turn out not\nto be quite as true as advertised, once you get around to\nit. So I'm aware that even documentaries will\ntake massive liberties, you can't be too harsh on what is\npopular fiction. On the other hand, I am also aware that it is by far, by\na ludicrous degree, the most popular bit of any kind of media\nthat includes my work, as it were, or something that I'm\nactively engaged in and know about, and so whether or not it should have that\ninfluence or the filmmakers should have responsibility, it does. It\ndoes have that knock-on. So I mean, it's simple as stuff as a T-rex\ncan't see if you can't move. Yeah, it could. I don't know where that came from. As\nfar as I can tell, Crichton just dreamed it up. In The Lost World, his sequel book, he hints that there's a research paper that\nsays it, and that's where he got it from. There's a second\npaleontologist character who's advising Dodgson,\nthe evil InGen guy, and he says, \"Oh, no, well that's from such-and-such's\nresearch.\" And I tried looking it up. As far as I can tell, it doesn't exist and\nnever did. So I think it's just straight fiction. And it's like, it works for the\nbook and it works for the movie, but as far as I can tell, it's straight\nfiction and Crichton just made it up. If it's buried in some bit of literature,\nhe's done better finding it than I have, and I've had a really good look and I know how\nto look. And I've never come across anyone who's found it either.\nBut it just warps the perception, you know. Velociraptor,\ncheetah speed, pack hunters, super intelligent, giant-sized animals and...\nokay, 1993, it's a bit more forgivable, but even then, we were pretty\nconfident they had feathers. confident they had feathers. - Is any of that true? Wait, so... - Probably not. - The pack hunter aspect of it? - So that's something I've written quite a lot about.\nThe evidence for pack hunting in any dinosaur at all is almost nonexistent. It basically doesn't\nexist. And that's going exactly back to, again, basically doesn't exist. And that's\ngoing exactly back to, again, that that stuff we were talking about, bite marks and taphonomy and,\nlike, the history of specimens and how you interpret stuff. history of specimens and h-\nand how you interpret stuff. - So, so what kind of evidence would show,\nlike, maybe bite marks from multiple sources? - So it's really, really tough. So the main one\nwhich was put forward is... there's this famous forward is... there's\nthis famous association association in Montana of Deinonychus, which is often\nconfused with Velociraptor, including in the books and movie. Basically a bigger version of this\nthat's rather older, from the early Cretaceous, version of this that's\nrather older, from the early and a thing called Tenontosaurus, which is kind of\niguanodontian. So an iguanodon with spiky thumbs. Basically, otherwise, a fairly run-of-the-mill\nherbivore. And there are two sites, I believe, for this, fairly run-of-the-mill\nherbivore. And there are two but there's one that's much more important, where you\nhave a Tenontosaurus carcass with Deinonychus carcasses. a Tenontosaurus carcass with Deinonychus carcasses. And\nso the interpretation of this And so the interpretation of this is, well, this\nis a group that brought down the herbivore. And of course, the immediate kind of counterargument\nto that is, \"Well, why did they all die there?\" all die there?\" Like, when, you know, when lions kill a wildebeest,\nthey eat it. They don't all just die next to it. it. They don't all just die next to it. Or even if they did kill it and start eating it,\nand then, like, if they got into a fight and killed each other, well, lions as a species are not gonna\nhang around for very long if every time they kill something they get into a mortal fight and kill half\ntheir pride. There's nothing obvious that killed them, half their pride. Um, there's nothing\nobvious that killed them but it's at but it's at least possible that this was something like\na predator trap. So predator traps are really neat. So La Brea Tar Pits is a classic example. The\nidea is a herbivore stumbles into something example. The idea is a herbivore\nstumbles into something like like tar. You've got your deer or wildebeest or mammoth\nor whatever it is, waist deep in tar and going, \"I'm dying, I'm dying,\" and making horrible noises,\nand, you know, Smilodon walks over and goes, \"Great,\" horrible noises, and, you know,\nSmilodon walks over and goes, and wades out after it, and he's now stuck.\nAnd then the next one, and then the next one, and the next one, and the next one. And then, lo and behold,\nyou now have something like La Brea where they've got, And then lo and behold, you now have\nsomething like La Brea where they've got, like, the numbers are something absurd. Like I think\nthey've got, like, three mammoths and one ground sloth, and then it's like a hundred dire wolves and 40\nSmilodon because it's just sucking the carnivores in. and 40 Smilodon because it's\njust sucking the carnivores in. - Wow. - And you get these really distorted ratios.\nI don't think that's the case with the Deinonychus-Tenontosaurus stuff because\nthere's ways that you can probably... because there's ways that you can probably\nrule that out. But there are probably places like this where it's happened.\nAgain, the other one is the toxin one, whose name— Yeah, Cleveland-Lloyd, so\nit's just coming up on your screen. That's another one with loads of\ndinosaurs. There's Allosaurus. But we've definitely seen it with... I\nthink this has come up with something like lions or wolves. Like, they\nfound loads of them dead by a lake and it turned out... or this pond.\nAnd this pond had got some really sort of nasty algal bloom toxin in it,\nand the interpretation was the same kind of thing, is that,\nlike, a couple of deer were drinking. This stuff's toxic and\nkills you within minutes. Keels over, dies. A wolf smells\ndead meat, comes over, starts eating it, has a drink,\nkeels over and dies. So it's not getting— you're just dying from the\ntoxicity rather than being, like, physically sucked in and trapped. But the same\neffect can happen, and so you just end up with a pile of dead bodies. - So I'm pulling up some stuff here.\nFirst of all, shout out to Perplexity. Super awesome. It'd be great\nif you fact-check some of this stuff. So, fossil discoveries,\nincluding parallel trackways and bone beds containing multiple tyrannosaurs\nsuggests these large predators sometimes moved and possibly hunted\nin groups. You as a person who wrote a book about the behavior of dinosaurs. - Yep. Let me deconstruct\nthat almost instantly. So it's... because it's really easy,\ncause this is... My book on dinosaur behavior, this is just the kind\nof thing I'm talking about. So the tyrannosaur trackways of a\ngroup of tyrannosaurs is, I think, four or five tracks total.\nSo it's, like, two from one animal, two from a second animal, and one from a\nthird animal. That's not the end of the world. That's somehow how trackways\nform. Like, you know, the rock's broken up. They stood on mud,\nand then they didn't, whatever. - Just to clarify, trackways means\nfootprints of multiple, maybe, steps? - Yeah. One of them has got a left and\nright, and the other two don't. It's very fragmentary, but I have no... That's\nnot a problem with the interpretation. The problem is this is interpreted\nas a group of them moving together. Well, why? Because they're going in roughly the same\ndirection. Okay. And they're roughly equal sizes. Okay. But, like, I've\nseen solitary animals moving in groups. A guy I know quite\nwell in South Africa... I go to South Africa regularly for my\nteaching, actually, and he's one of the big guys at South Africa National Parks,\nand he gives me the skinny on all kinds of weird stuff. And he was telling me\na few years ago that one of his park rangers had observed leopards hunting\ntogether in a group. Now, leopards are basically not just solitary, they're like\nantisocial. Like, they beat the hell out of each other if they come near\neach other. But I've also seen... you know, you get... Game trails\nare a thing, paths that single animals take. If a female is in heat, like,\nmales will track her down and follow her. So you'll get one set of footprints, and then\na couple of hours later a male will come past, and a couple of hours later another male\nwill come past. And now you've got three sets of footprints all traveling in the same direction\non the same bit of path, but they live on their own. Let alone hunting together,\nwhich is a massive step above this. And then the one I've talked about quite a\nbit in my book is spotted hyena, Crocuta crocuta, which is the one... There's a whole bunch\nof hyenas, but this is the one everyone knows. They're the big laughing hyena.\nAnd you can see plenty of Attenborough-type documentaries of\nthem, seven or eight of them, or even 10 or 12 of them going into a herd and ripping\napart wildebeest or zebra or whatever it is. But actually, if you read the scientific\nliterature, this is really rare. They mostly hunt on their own. Now\nthey do live in these social clans with hierarchies and\ncomplex social interactions. They are very social animals. But they\nmostly hunt on their own. So even if you find loads of trackways\nof them moving together or as ... Again, there's one, if not two, for tyrannosaurs,\nwhere we've got multiple tyrannosaurs together, and that's been argued for\npack hunting. At best, that argues they might have lived together,\nbut it doesn't tell you whether or not they hunted together. - So, how can we make a decision\non one way or the other? - So, I mean, I tend to be ultra conservative in this context, and\nI think we should probably avoid saying things that we're not quite\nconfident about. I don't want to ever go down the, \"We must have really definitive,\n100% convincing evidence,\" because this is paleo and we don't have that kind of data. But just as I talked about with\nthings like the predator prey size ratio stuff, there is data\nwe can start to use on living species about what tends to trigger hunting in groups or living in groups,\nand what data there might be from stuff like brain sizes or other\ntrackways. Or again, we do have bite marks indicating prey\nsize. If you start finding repeated attacks on big\nprey from relatively small predators, that would be quite\nconvincing. As you said, maybe we had bite marks of multiple\ndifferent sizes. Now, that on its own, it comes hard, because\nobviously scavenging, you know, tyrannosaurs are an exception. Most dinosaurs,\nmost carnivorous dinosaurs have pretty similarly shaped teeth.\nSo, how easy is it to tell an adult from a juvenile from an\nadult from a different species that's just a bit smaller? Probably pretty\ntricky. I mean, for me, I think the kind of gold standard, which I\ndon't think we're ever going to find but you never know, like, you could, in\ntheory, get a trackway of something like a herbivore with a whole bunch\nof carnivore tracks coming by it. We do have a couple like this, but they\ndon't have what I really want to see, which is if you trace the footprints\nof the individual carnivores, and if A's in... Early on,\nA's footprints go on top of B's, but later on, B's\ngo on top of A's, they must have been there at the same\ntime because there's no way they could have been even minutes\nor hours apart. So, if you had that, then those two must be\ntogether, or at least within sight of each other and one's not turning around and\nroaring or having a fight. If you can do that, If you can do that with seven or eight,\nall converging on one herbivore, and then everything goes manic, well,\nthat's really pretty convincing. - It is so fascinating and\nawesome, the like the Sherlock Holmes aspect of paleontology, like\nfiguring out, because you have very little signal- very little signal and you have to\nfigure out the puzzle of it from that. And like, that's it's, it's just you're brilliant.\nYou're giving so many brilliant examples of, yeah, if A steps on top of B, and then B steps on top\nof A, that's a strong signal that they were walking together. - I am a bit of a Sherlock\nHolmes fan, and he references Cuvier. So Cuvier was this\nlegendary French anatomist, Baron Cuvier. He was the first guy\nto posit that things went extinct, working on mammoths. And he said, \"Well, there's\nnothing like this alive today, so extinction happens.\" Which before that, we\ndidn't really know. And Holmes has a line about, \"Just as Cuvier can restore an animal from the smallest bone,\nso I can restore the events from the smallest detail,\" or I- - Damn. - I'm paraphrasing, but I'm not far off. - Yeah, there's truth to that. - You, you have used an analogy that Conan\nDoyle specifically used for Holmes going back to paleontology. - I mean, it's obvious. It's\nclear. It's right there, yeah. - That, that's how on the\nnose you are with that one. - So, okay. So basically you clarified\nand showed all the things in Jurassic got it wrong. - Yeah, we, we, yeah, we got off-topic\nbefore we even got onto Jurassic Park. - Uh, and just Velociraptor, you said that\nthe, you know, the, yeah, the size, the pack hunting, all of that. - The pack hunting, just to round\noff on that, like, I don't know. Maybe there's actually been some more\nrecent stuff on Deinonychus looking at things like isotopes in the\nteeth and feeding traces and some other stuff that's hinting that\nmaybe there is more going on there, which is great. I'm, I'm not\nanti the idea that this exists, but you absolutely get this\nbuild up of the idea that velociraptors are a pack hunter comes\nfrom Deinonychus and I think the evidence from Deinonychus is really\nweak, in exactly the way that... Okay, lions are group hunters.\nWe know they are. Does that mean that leopards are? And tigers and puma? No. So why on earth do you\nthink that just because, even if Velociraptor. Group\nhunting has all kinds of more complicated dynamics going on it\nthan just close relatives tend to do it. You can flip that around, you know. African hunting dog, wolves,\nthings like bush dogs. There's various canids that all hunt in groups,\nbut then you've got things like maned wolves which are\neffectively solitary. The hyenas. Spotted hyenas are, yeah, these\nsuper social animals, but the brown hyena, the striped hyena and the\naardwolf are solitary. So you just So you just can't do group versus solitary off close\nrelatives or anything like that. I am very sure close relatives or anything like that. I am very sure a ton\nof dinosaurs were aggregates, lived in groups to some degree, a ton of dinosaurs were aggregates, lived in groups to some degree,\nand I'm very sure some of them were social with complex lives and I'm very sure some of them were social with complex\nlives and hierarchies and even pack hunting. Which ones, I and hierarchies and even pack hunting. Which ones, I have\nvery little idea because I think the data is so sparse have very little idea because I think the data is so\nsparse that we can't really say it with any confidence for that we can't really say it with any confidence for\nanything, in my opinion. I think that can be gotten at. anything, in my opinion. I think that can be gotten at. I think we\nneed to start getting at it with the sort of stuff I'm talking about. I think we need to start getting at it with the sort of stuff I'm talking\nabout. Like get a better understanding of what drives sociality in lions Like get a better understanding of what drives sociality in lions\nversus tigers versus leopards. You know, relatively close relatives tigers versus leopards. You know, relatively close relatives\nwho overlap. Don't forget in India, leopards and tigers who overlap. Don't forget in India, leopards and tigers\noverlap with lions. The Asiatic lion is still there. overlap with lions. The Asiatic lion is still there. So\nyou can talk about ecosystem structure and prey size So you can talk about ecosystem structure and prey size\nand prey type and all this stuff. Maybe we can start and prey type and all this stuff. Maybe we can start piecing\nthat together a bit better and then apply that to stuff piecing that together a bit better and then apply that to stuff\nlike the track ways and the isotopes and all the rest of it. Bite marks and these mass mortality sites. So I think it can\nbe done, but personally like what were pack hunters? No idea. but personally like what\nwere pack hunters? No idea. No idea. I don't think any of them were in the sense that\nI don't think we've got good evidence for any of them. I don't think we've got good evidence for any of them. But there\nprobably exists on Earth definitive evidence one way or the other. - But there probably exists on earth\ndefinitive evidence one way or the other. - Yeah, probably for some of them. I mean, I think it's well\nwithin their scope. One of the papers writing about this, One of the papers writing about this, ironically, arguing\nagainst pack hunting in Deinonychus, said that, \"Well, against pack hunting in Deinonychus, said that, \"Well, it's\nprobably not the case because you don't really see pack hunting it's probably not the case because you don't really see pack hunting\nin birds. And so if you don't see it in birds, then dinosaurs in birds. And so if you don't see it in birds, then dinosaurs\nbeing their ancestor, well, if birds can't evolve it, being their ancestor, well, if birds can't evolve it,\nthen maybe dinosaurs couldn't have evolved it.\" Which I'm not sure is a great logical argument because of the complexities\nof social behavior anyway. But then there are a couple of birds of social behavior anyway. But then there are a couple of birds which\nactively hunt in groups. Things like the giant ground hornbills. which actively hunt in groups. Things like the giant ground hornbills.\nEthiopia and South Africa are a really good example of that. Ethiopia and South Africa are a really good example of that.\nSo that point is incorrect. And then we see if not true So that point is incorrect. And then we see if not true\nsociality, we see cooperation in crocodilians and we're sociality, we see cooperation in crocodilians and we're\nseeing degrees of social behavior in things like iguanas. seeing degrees of social behavior in things like iguanas.\nSo the idea that, \"Well, birds are super advanced So the idea that, \"Well, birds are super advanced and dinosaurs\ncan't do it 'cause the stupid reptiles are too stupid, and dinosaurs can't do it 'cause the stupid reptiles are too stupid,\nand therefore dinosaurs are more like them,\" which isn't quite and therefore dinosaurs are more like them,\" which isn't quite what\nthey're saying, but it's sort of the unwritten idea, \"Well, we have what they're saying, but it's sort of the unwritten idea, \"Well, we\nhave social behavior and cooperation behavior in crocs and in lizards. social behavior and cooperation behavior in crocs and in lizards. So\nthat really gives you the impression that dinosaurs, theoretically, So that really gives you the impression that dinosaurs, theoretically,\nat least, are perfectly capable of that. So there's pack hunting, - at least, are perfectly capable of that. So there's pack hunting,\nbut there's also sociality, which is such an interesting idea. but there's also sociality, which is such an interesting\nidea. It's how did they live? And this is something you look It's how did they live? And this is something you look at\nthat paleontology doesn't often touch, is like, the lives. - Yeah, because, you know, animals are doing complicated things.\nSo, in the case of lions, a large part of this is down to So, in the case of lions, a large part of this is down to territoriality\nin that the males ultimately are defending the territory, territoriality in that the males ultimately are defending the territory,\nand that's effectively protecting the females. But, of course, and that's effectively protecting the females. But, of course,\nwhat they're mostly protecting them from is other males. what they're mostly protecting them from is other males.\nSo there's a ludicrous bit of self-interest. But that's self-interest. But that's\neffectively how it's operating as a system. But it could just be predatory type. Cheetahs\nare my go-to example for this. So cheetahs are the weird ones\ncompared to the other cats because females are solitary, but\nmales are social. So brothers will... when, you know, if the\nfemale has five or six cubs, the brothers will stay together in a group and\nthen the girls will go off on their own. And if you're the only brother or the\nonly survivor, you will usually hook up, hook up with a gang of other males. So\ncheetahs are pack hunters if you're male and a solitary hunter if you're\nfemale. So it's not about territory defense or occupation\nfor them. It's about prey type. - Is it possible to know the\nsex of a T-Rex or any of the other dinosaurs? What can\npaleontology show us? - So in theory, yes. In practice,\nit's way more complicated. So unless you get very lucky, we have\na handful of specimens that still have eggs inside them, instant giveaway.\nBut this is like two or three. Um, what you can look for is both\nreptiles and birds have a thing called medullary bone,\nand when you're laying eggs and you need a lot of calcium\nvery quickly because the egg shell goes on basically, like, the\nlast minute during egg development. So you need a lot of calcium very quickly.\nSo during the laying season, these animals grow this really\nweird kind of bone texture on big things like the femur and the\nhumerus, like really big bones in the body. And that's... It's got a weird\ntexture because it's full of blood vessels, and it's full of blood vessels so\nthat you can basically apply a lot of blood supply to it quickly, suck up some\nof the calcium from that bone, take it through the system, put\nit on the eggs, lay your eggs. We can find that. So if you have a dinosaur bone and it's the right kind of thing,\nso you can't do it on like a finger or a claw or a bit of rib, but nice big\nbone, you could cut a chunk of that out, grind it down to the point that it's virtually\ntransparent, a fraction of a millimeter thick, put it under a microscope and have a look.\nAnd if you see the right bone texture, that's... there are some exceptions,\nbut that's very probably medullary bone, and you have yourself a female. So the instant assumption is, okay, so you\ncan tell female from male. No, we can tell laying female from\neverything else. So males won't have medullary bone. Young\nfemales won't have them. Females outside of the breeding season won't have\nit. Females inside the breeding season, but maybe they've been really sick this year,\ndon't have it. Or they laid their eggs early and now they don't need it\nanymore, won't have it. So occasionally, if you cut up a bone, which\nof course we try not to do that much, you can get the signal of medullary bone\nand infer that you have a female in the breeding season. - But so there's no like large\nbone structure differences? - Well, maybe there is, but we haven't\nseen it. You look at things like kudu or blackbuck and all kinds of\nantelope or even most deer, and the males have horns or\nantlers and the females don't. And then you look at something like\nTriceratops and all the ceratopsians. There's a big clade of...\noh, must be 40 species by now. And every single one of\nthem has the frill and has some kind of horn somewhere. You don't have the hornless ones or the frill-less\nones in the way that we do with a lot of these. - I'm trying to figure out, is there,\nhow many of the species is it obvious that there's like, like pelvis\ndifferences, all that kind of stuff? - So pelvis differences works\non like humans and apes and maybe a couple of other mammals, but it's\nmostly not very good because we are... It's because we give birth to such a\ngigantic baby with a gigantic head compared to our sizes that women\nhave different pelvises to men. - And then there's size differences, like the\nskull is not as reliable as the pelvis. - It's, it's not. And then again, you just\nneed to look at, you know, humans are always slightly dodgy with this because of, you\nknow, our evolutionary and cultural history. But like, you know, there's\npopulation differences. You know, you, you... There are, there are\nmaned female lions in places. There are maneless male lions in places. Um, reindeer, female reindeer\nhave antlers in winter. So Rudolph was a girl, because every\nillustration of Santa and his reindeer ever, they all have antlers, and that's that's\na female reindeer, not a male if it's winter. - So basically, we don't know much about\nthe dating and the sex lives of T-rexes. - Well, not much, but you can make some\ninferences. So for example, all tyrannosaurs have at least some kind of crest on the\nhead. The early ones have like this midline crest. It really doesn't work on\na human. They have like a midline crest running along the top of the nose\nthat sticks up. The later ones largely don't, but they do have\nthis weird armored structure along those fused nasals and then\nthey have little horns over the eyes. Those as far as we can\ntell, don't really have any kind of obvious mechanical function and\nloads, like outside of the feathered dinosaurs, the vast majority\nof carnivorous dinosaurs have some kind of crestal\ndisplay feature on the head. - When you say display feature, meaning\nfor sex appeal to attract mates? - Or something like that. So\nI've always favored the term socio-sexual selection\nto cover both sexual display and sexual dominance\nand communication, but also social ones, because those two things\nare hard to tell apart. Female lions find males with\ndarker manes sexier, but male lions find males\nwith darker manes more intimidating. So one of them is\nsex, but one of them is social. - Nice. - And then- - I mean, I guess it goes\nhand-in-hand, sure. Yeah. - It can, but then you get things like\nthe other one I go for is black swans, these beautiful Australian birds.\nThey have these really weird curly feathers on their wings. And males\nand females both have them, and males prefer females with curlier\nfeathers, and females prefer males with curlier feathers. There's an obvious\nsexual link, but then females fight too. Females fight over the\nbest nesting spots, and the females with the curliest\nfeathers tend to win those fights. - How does that make sense? - This gets into classic sexual selection\ntheory. It's what's called an honest signal. You couldn't have those curly\nfeathers if you weren't able to support them. Because they're the primary feathers on\nthe wings, and what it actually does is it makes it harder to fly. So you're basically\ngoing, \"Look how tough I am. I've grown this big and I can fly and carry\non with my giant curly feathers because I'm really tough and I'm in good\nshape.\" And it's the same with the lion. The reason you get pale lions in the\nsouth is because it's close to the equator, because it's too hot. So there's the trade-off, because if\nyou have a really black mane, all the males know you're rock and all the\nfemales know you're super sexy, but you just die of overheating.\nThe trade-off is if the heat's going to kill you, you're probably\nbetter off being a bit paler and surviving in order to\nreproduce than you are being jet black but just dying\ninstantly as soon as it gets hot. - So there's trade-offs there, okay. - Yeah, and that's probably\nwhat's happening with the theropods. All the little crests and horns, Ceratosaurus, Dilophosaurus,\ntyrannosaurs, allosaurs have big crests over the eyes,\nand all kinds of others. I've written about this, I think this is\nthe trade-off. You're going for the sexiest look, and the sexiest look is the biggest horns\nor the biggest spikes and whatever's on the head, probably also then with the\nbrightest colors and the most display patterns, but also this gives you away to your prey. If you're trying to hide or\nyou're trying to sneak up on something, being brightly colored or having stripes\nor all this extra stuff on your head, you get spotted. But then\nthat's the trade-off. is if I'm this big and my horns\nare, if my horns are this big and this red and yellow\nand I can still, whoop, I can still run those guys down and\nhunt them and kill them and eat them. Then look how great I must be.\nWhereas that little guy, he's only got weedy little crests\nand they're really dark because he's so bad at catching\nstuff he doesn't have the extra energy to grow big crests. And\nthat's why. But when you're a herbivore, you don't have that pressure,\nparticularly something like, this is Protoceratops, but somebody like Triceratops\nand these guys, they're living in big groups. You can't hide from a predator when you're\na group of 20 animals that are 10 tons each, so who cares? You\njust grow the biggest signal you can possibly grow, and lo\nand behold, they have giant frills and giant horns. - What can you say about\nbeauty in evolution? Something that's, maybe you can educate\nme, but something that's not quite an honest signal that's just pure\nbeauty like peacock feathers? - So there are things which we think\noperate closer to that. So there are, these are the two classic ideas\nof sexual selection, and both are probably true to certain degrees in various\ndifferent species. One is the honest signal or the, it's the kind of handicap\nhypothesis because you're holding yourself back whilst proving\nyou can still do it. I ran the marathon, you know, carrying\na couple of weights. You're obviously stronger than the guy who\nran the marathon without. And so that's why it's an honest signal and it's why it's\na handicap. But the other one is what's called the But the other one is what's\ncalled the sexy sons hypothesis. The idea is a female might just find a male\nattractive for no other reason than random. There is some component of her brain,\nor whatever it may be, that just looks cool, and you can\nactually sort of get this as a human. Forget human beauty,\nyou can look at a bottle and go, \"That bottle's kind of nice,\nand that bottle's kind of ugly.\" - Where do you put birds? Birds\nare interesting with this. Where do you put peacock feathers? - So they're probably more of a\nhandicap hypothesis because the colors that go into them and\nthe sheer size and shape— - Oh, I see. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - ...and these things basically can't fly.\nThey're really vulnerable to predators. - Can the handicap hypothesis explain just\nhow beautiful peacock feathers get? - So- - They go extreme with it. - So, probably not entirely. There's\nalmost certainly randomness going on in there as well. And then the eye spots.\nWe know that eye spots are attractive are probably encoded in some way. But yeah,\ngoing back to the sexy sons, the idea is females prefer something different\nfor whatever reason, and there might actually be some reasons females\nprefer things that are different. Different usually means\nseparate and outside, and that usually comes\nwith variation inherently. - Oh, so variation is an\nevolutionary turn-on? - Yeah, basically. - Wouldn't it? Man, you're rolling\nthe dice, though, aren't you? - Yeah, well, you... - Right. - You've got to remember, again, it's really\neasy to look at that sort of thing with a human perspective where,\nat maximum, reproductive output, I think the record — there's\nsome obscure record — it's something like 66 children, which is\nprobably apocryphal for a Russian woman who had loads\nof triplets and quads. But, humans don't have many\noffspring, but most animals lay dozens of eggs or hundreds of\neggs or thousands of eggs at a time. - So, diversity pays off more there. - So diversity can pay off. We think that's\nprobably a major part of the reason that sex evolved in the first place: it gives you resistance to a changing environment and\nit gives you resistance to parasites and diseases which often reproduce\nway faster than you do. bacteria can divide in a few hours.\nWe reproduce every 20 years. That's quite a difference. If\nwe were all asexual clones and you're vulnerable to some disease,\nyou're probably going to get wiped out. Look at the Irish Potato\nFamine, or something like that. So different may be appealing\nsimply because it is different. variation. And there's at\nleast some evidence for that. There's swordtails.\nSo anyone who keeps little fish — if anyone's\na tropical fish keeper, swordtails are really quite common\nlittle tropical fish that you can get in all kinds of aquarium shops, and\nthey're a very boring fish shape. their tail has a big spike on it,\nand that's the name. They're really close relatives of a group called the\nmollies, which basically don't have that. In the wild, these are\nAmazonian fish; they don't usually encounter each other, but even if you go\nand get not even the domesticated form, because these things have been bred for, you know,\ndecades at this point, you can go and get some wild mollies and give them a wild\nmale swordtail, and they think he's so much better than\nall the male mollies. They will go for that one, and they will preferentially\nmate with that one. We don't know the exact mechanism, but it appears to be,\nhe looks similar enough that I recognize it as a potential mate but\ndifferent enough that this is exciting. And then this is where the sexy sons kick\nin because the females are now assuming those animals are successful, and\nthey can hybridize, or maybe it's just a male who just happens to be a little bit\nblue or a little bit red or whatever it may be. Well, the female offspring, the daughters are probably going to\ninherit mother's preference, I really like red, and the males are probably going to have red in them\nbecause their dad had more red. So guess what the next generation does?\nThere's more red, and the females like more red, and you don't have to\ncome back much further, and suddenly all the males are bright red. And that's closer to beauty than I think almost\nanything else would be, with still a naturalistic explanation. - We kind of started talking about\nbeauty from how much social life - Yeah, a T-rex might have. - a T-rex might have, so just to kind of take that to a place of what we know\nand what we don't know. So can we kind of know something about their social\nlife, where they lived, how they lived? - So the very fact that they have\nthese apparently socio-sexually selected signals, the little\ncrest and stuff in the head. So there's a branch of sexual selection called mutual sexual\nselection, and the black swans are an example of this. The classic sexual\nselection is your peacocks and your lions and things like this.\nMales are bigger and more flamboyant and whatever it is, and\nthey're doing all the competing. But mutual sexual selection, and this\nis really common in a whole bunch of things that people are familiar with\nbut don't know. Loads of seabirds, starlings, the common starling that we have in\nEurope and has been introduced into the U.S., parrots, various other\nthings, where basically males and females invest\nsimilarly in rearing the offspring. So the idea generally,\nboth with handicap and sexy son, but particularly with handicap,\nis the idea that males are proving their worth. They're basically saying, \"I'm the\nbiggest, strongest, healthiest, I've got the best genes, I should be the father of\nyour offspring.\" They go around showing off and then mate with\nas many females as possible. While the females then do all the\nwork and make the nest and look after the chicks and, yeah, or rear them or give\nbirth or whatever it may be, yada, yada, yada. So the idea with mutual sexual\nselection is, what if there's not much food around? Things like puffins or, you know, penguins\nin the Arctic where the male sits with the egg and the female toddles off, gets food, and\nthen comes back two months later or whatever it is. On their own, they can't rear\nthe offspring. They have to have a male investment. Well, suddenly the\nmale's now putting loads of effort in, so the male's now in the same position\nthat a female would be in under the normal conditions. You don't want to be the\nsexiest, toughest, biggest male, and you can only mate once, all right?\nThere are various cheats, but we won't get into that just yet. You're only going to mate\nonce and you're going to put all your effort into helping rearing offspring, rather than chasing\ndown as many girls as possible. Are you going to go for the biggest, fittest female as\nwell, or are you going to go for the small, weedy one that doesn't look very well?\nYou go for the best one. Well, how do you know that? Well, because\nshe's got a crest as well, and so suddenly you now get mutual\nornamentation just like the black swans where the males are checking\nout the curliest females, and the females are checking out the curliest\nmales, and you'll see they mutually pair up. This is what we see with things like\nstarlings. Males like the brightest females, females like the brightest males,\nthey tend to form pairs. The darkest and least bright ones are obviously kind of\nleft with each other at the bottom of the pile. They tend to pair up. But it means that\nwhen you've got signals in both males and females, like every\ntriceratops or every tyrannosaurus, it at least hints\nthat they're going down this route, and that they might\ncooperate for reproduction. - Wow. Another like weak signal\nthat tells a powerful story. - Yeah, and the problem is it's compromised by lots\nof things. So that goes back to your earlier question about telling males from females\napart. The vast majority of dinosaur species, like 90 plus percent,\nare known from a single specimen. And a specimen is not necessarily\nvery complete at all. It might be a couple of bones, it might be one bone,\nit might be a tooth in a couple of cases. The actual number where\nwe've got a decent number of real whole skeletons that we can\nactually compare to each other, less than 10. Probably\nmore like five or six. - Can I ask you a weird question?\nIf you were to, let's say, all humans died right now— ...press a button, poof, gone, how\nmuch of human civilization would you be able to reconstruct from\njust the skeletons that are in the ground? Like, you just start collecting\nskeletons. There's a lot of them. There are billions of them. Would\nyou be able to start telling a story, like urban centers? - Yeah, probably, because— - You could probably\nreconstruct a lot, right? - And if nothing else, just the, you\nknow, superlative brain cavity will tell you quite a lot, you know. - Yeah, the intelligence. - Must have been very, very smart with... - You could- - ...a brain that big. - You can probably reconstruct some of the\nbehavior, a lot of the behavior, social behavior. A lot of this stuff. - And you're going to see stuff like, you know,\nit's the famous one of... I think it was a Neanderthal. There was a famous question\nof like, you know, \"At what point do you think society exists?\" And maybe\none of the Leakeys but the answer was basically this skeleton\nbecause it was someone with a real-like a properly busted\nleg and then it fully healed. And it's like if that\nperson was on their own, just dead, someone had to look\nafter them for months to get that level of healing. You\nonly do that to someone you're really devoted to and probably a group of\npeople 'cause even one person can't look after one other person,\nright? So that's your society. And yet you think about\nthe pathology of skeletons in the human race. How, you know,\nhow many of us have broken a bone? Most adults have probably\nbroken a couple of bones even if it's just a finger or a nose or something. But then you think about what\nmedicine has done and you would be able to see treatments of complete\ncompound fractures of guys who survived horrific car crashes\nand treatments of cancer, bone cancers and stuff like that. You would see\nthat. Well, how is that happening? Either they're magic or they've got some kind\nof... In which case, they'd probably cure it instantly or there's some kind of\ntechnology in society supporting that change. - That just hints at the fact that\nthe evidence collection and the reasoning mechanisms that paleontology\nand archaeology uses is really powerful. - Yeah, it is. - And so it could be very effective even\njust with a small amount of data. I mean you could- - But it's the right amount of data. That's\nthe thing. We can find dozens of skeletons that we can't do very much with and\nthen the right one that, you know, things like stomach contents, you know, that's a\nsuper or bite marks is a super powerful bit of data but it doesn't turn up that often.\nSo it's not like you can get it off every skeleton. And that's the thing,\nit's the pool of data and I think that's what people miss. We, as\npaleontologists, we get caught up on single superlative\nspecimens and then try and treat them as a... like\na silver bullet almost. So Microraptor, I mentioned this before,\nlittle flying dinosaur, crow-sized or gliding dinosaur. Crow-sized thing\nfrom China. We've got at least a dozen good specimens of it by now\nand multiple ones with stomach contents. There's one I've described\nwith a little mammal foot inside it, there's one with a bird inside it, there's\none with a lizard inside it and there's one with a fish inside it. On their\nown, and this happened for at least two of the papers describing\nthese things, it's like, \"It ate fish. These are fish-eating\nanimals.\" No, that one ate one fish once. That one ate one bird once, that one ate one mammal\nonce and that one ate one lizard once. So what have we actually got here? I suspect we've got a group of generalists and we just\nhappen to have found them eating different things at different times. But\nequally, it's also possible, at least, that, yeah, this is one of\nthese things and it had learned to eat fish when the others hadn't and actually\nthis was mostly fish eaters and the others ate whatever they could get. Maybe\none caught a bird up a tree in a nest. Maybe one found it dead on the\nground. You don't really know what one of these things on its own is\nfascinating, but potentially misleading. - Well, the way you're describing it now, it seems\nlike, yes, it's potentially misleading, but there's... in your whole way of being\nand the way you've been talking about this stuff I can see that it's not just the direct evidence you're\nmentioning. It's like, it's a bunch of intuitions you build up. It's like\nyou're stitching together a bunch of little things... It's the Sherlock Holmes\nthing. Not just this one piece of evidence. this one piece of evidence- ... it's like, \"Okay, what do\nI know about the general other dinosaurs that are on the\nEarth? The different animals-\" ... how animals usually behave about this period,\nabout the environment?\" And all of that comes together, and then- ...\nfiguring out which is true. - And that's... So one thing I've\ndefinitely written about is, yeah, the independent lines\nof evidence. Can you get stuff that is as far as possible truly independent from the other\ndata and does it give you the same answer? And then when it does- - That's powerful. - ... that's incredibly powerful.\nSo Spinosaurus or the- the spinosaurs as a whole is\nmy go-to example for this are the... guys with the famous big sail\nback and the weird crocodile-like head, though some of them look rather\ndifferent to that. And if you look across all the species and specimens that we have,\nincredibly fragmentary and very badly known, but they're all basically associated\nwith... When you look at the gestalt, you see a whole bunch of stuff\nfor these things. So they do have a surprisingly crocodile-like head\nand crocodile-like teeth compared to every other carnivorous dinosaur. And when\nyou do the mechanical analysis, you see they function in a very\nsimilar way. And indeed, teeth, here's a spinosaur tooth\nwith very nearly circular cross section, really distinctive,\nsimilar to crocodiles, similar to dolphins, similar to fish-eating fish. So points to fish.\nCrocodile-like head, points to fish. Crocs eat other\nstuff too, but still. Um, they're usually found in or\nnear aquatic systems now. Fossils in general tend to turn up in aquatic systems\nbecause you've got to be buried to become a fossil. So water association is common,\nbut even so, that's true. They turn up in places where lots of\nother dinosaurs don't tend to turn up, including carnivores, which\nsuggests they're eating something else. If you look at the\nisotopic signature of the teeth, often it correlates\nwith crocodiles, fish, turtles, and stuff that lives in\nwater, and doesn't correlate well with other land-living dinosaurs that\nlived in the same time and same place. So you put all of that together,\nand it's really hard to argue... Oh, in addition to the tiny\ndetail of Baryonyx, the British one was found with fish scales inside\nits chest cavity. So you put all of that together, and yeah, I'm\nnot saying it only ate fish. I'm sure it ate big shrimp and\nturtles. And we know they were predating on terrestrial dinosaurs and\npterosaurs because, again, stomach contents and teeth and stuff.\nBut fundamentally, this is an animal or a group of animals doing something\ndifferent to the other carnivorous dinosaurs, and it's probably linked\nto water, and it's probably linked to fish as a predominant way of living. - We should mention that you're\nworking on a book out in early 2026? - In the UK it will be out in November. In\nNorth America, January or February 2026. - It's called Spinosaur Tales: The Biology\nand Ecology of the Spinosaurus. And... - Written with Mark Witton,\nwho did that picture. - It's a beautiful creature. - Which I think is in there. Mark's done\na ton of new artwork. He helped write the book, but he's also the artist. - I mean, can you describe a little bit more about\nthis creature? There's a bunch of stuff like what you just mentioned. There's\nsome debate. Like where- Is it... To what degree\nis it aquatic? So what- - Not very is my take. - So does it live in the water? Does it- - I... Yeah. So I think it's\nbasically a big wader. It's a poor analogy, but it's\na very weird, giant stork. - Oh. Got it. - Or heron. - Was giant. - Yeah. So potentially bigger\nthan T-Rex. Linearly, not in mass. Again, really quite\nnarrow chest versus that T-Rex barrel. But potentially 15\nmeters long, so bigger than any T-Rex we've found, at\nleast in terms of length. - Can you describe what it looks like? The... I\nmean, there's some iconic features to it, right? - Yeah. So this really quite long head, with a kind of wavy\njawline. Like, animals have You know, most carnivores have\nstraight jaws. This one has a kind of somewhat wiggly jawline. It really\nnarrows at the front and then opens up again into a like a little... It's called\na rosette. So you've got like a little semicircle, and then a dip, and then\nthe jaws go back, and then the teeth line waves up and down. These\nreally conical teeth, which doesn't sound very exciting, but it makes them different to every other carnivorous\ndinosaur. No other thing has a conical tooth, which is a classic fish\nthing, or at least biting hold of something that wriggles.\nThe nostrils are not at the tip of the nose. They're pushed back, at\nleast somewhat. It has a bunch of crests on the head. It's got quite a long\nneck. Spinosaurus and at least a couple of the other closest relatives\nto it, a thing called Ichthyovenator. from... I can't remember if it's Thailand\nor Laos. I think it's Laos. It has this giant elongated bit to the top\nof the vertebrae, so it gives it this giant sail along\nthe back. Spinosaurus, at least, possibly Ichthyovenator,\nprobably not any of the others, then has this weird, thin, newt-like expanse to the top of the tail, giving\nit kind of like a giant oar paddle appearance. Mostly they\nhave very large arms with giant claws on the hands. And Spinosaurus at least appears to have really\nquite short legs, but the others don't. But again, so Spinosaurus is totally iconic, but if you\nlook at something like Baryonyx from the UK or Suchomimus from Niger, it's still got the same head, neck,\nand arms, but it doesn't have this sail, and it doesn't have this tail, and it\nprobably doesn't have short legs. So Spinosaurus is super weird and\nexaggerated version of what was already a kind of super\nweird group of theropods. So Spinosaurus is properly\nstrange. And then, as you kind of hinted at, super controversial as\nwell, because various papers have claimed it's a diver or a really good\nswimmer, and I think the evidence for that is very weak at best. - So your book is going to be... You're going to start\nsome shit with your book. It's going to be all contro- - I think... I think I already have,\nto be honest. I've written... I've written three major papers, and\none in particular with my colleague, Tom Holt, where we frankly savaged the\nidea that it's a good swimmer. And then- - Oh. - ...other people have since, including some of\nthe authors who were on the original paper claiming it did swim well, have now effectively\nreversed their position and said it didn't. - So the Jurassic Park 3\nfight between the two- - Yeah. - ...who's famous. In a\nreal-life encounter, who wins? - Probably still T-Rex. I mean, the Jurassic\nPark Spinosaurus was pretty good for its time because some of the stuff\nthat I've just talked about, particularly the short legs were\nsuggested way back in 1910, 1912, but it was really uncertain. Now it appears to be more likely the\ncase than not. The tail was unknown at this point, so it was just\ngiven a very generic tail. But the crocodile-like head is pretty\ngood. The neck's a bit short. The sail is a bit too... It's almost\njust like a semicircle stuck on the back, and it's a bit more complicated\nthan that. But personally, I'm quite a big fan of the Jurassic Park 3\nSpinosaurus. I think for its era, it's really quite good. It is massive. There is\nthis... They're from, I'm going to say, Morocco, because Spinosaurus is found\nthroughout North Africa, Morocco, Algeria, Egypt. There's a\nmassive pair of jaws or snout that's in a collection in Milan that's absolutely outsized. It's like\nan absolute giant. And that points to a truly monumentally sized Spinosaurus,\nwhich is where all these upper estimates of 15-plus meters come from,\nis just this one set of jaws. But yeah, it's about right, but it's\njust a bit too muscly and a bit too bulky. But in gross\nappearance, it's pretty good. - Does it have a chance against a T-Rex? - No. Because it's got this\nunbelievably long, thin jaw, which whilst much\nstronger than something like Baryonyx, is fundamentally not that strong. The jaws\nare very long and thin, and then the teeth are... The jaws are very long and thin, and\nthen the teeth are... Yeah. They're big, but they're not... big, big. You know, the whole, like,\nit grabs the T-Rex neck and then, like, snaps it. Well, Spinosaurus actually, its neck is really\nstrong going up and down and is very weak rotating or going\nside to side. So it's got the weakest kind of possible neck to,\nlike, rotate and snap the T-Rex, and then T-Rex has got, like, the strongest\nneck of anything. So you've got, like, the weakest jaw with the weakest\nspin versus the strongest neck. So no, I don't buy it. - So that brings it back to the topic we\ntouched on a little bit. What are... You've mentioned a bunch of the stuff\nthat the Jurassic Park... ...series gets wrong? Maybe\nyou could speak to more things, but also, what does it get right? - So a lot of, like, very, in some level\ngeneric, but quite important things it gets right. T-Rex is about the\nright size and shape and is massive, and you don't actually see it run. You see\nit power walk. If you watch the Jeep chase again, you'll see it only ever has\none foot on the ground. The weird thing for me is how much\nsome of them vary. So, like, I'm a big pterosaur guy. I do lots of work on\npterosaurs, the flying reptiles. The Pteranodons in Jurassic Park Two: The Lost World, you see them very, very briefly in\none of the last shots and they're okay, but they're not great, but it's clearly a bit\nof a throwaway shot. The ones in Jurassic Park Three, I think are mostly\nexcellent. Really, really good. And then the ones in Jurassic\nWorld are terrible. Like, a massive regression. There's loads and\nloads of details that are right in JP3 that are completely wrong in Jurassic\nWorld, and you're like, \"Why did you take a really good model and make\nit much, much worse and less accurate?\" I don't understand. And I... Again, it's fiction. At one level, who\ncares? But, like, as you said, like, I don't think... So, see,\nthe weird thing for me is, I don't think it would\naffect how they're perceived by the public. Some things I\nget. Like, for example, in Jurassic World, the Pteranodons pick\npeople up with their feet and fly off with them. Pteranodon's feet don't work like that.\nIt would never be able to do that, and it would never have the lift. But I get for dramatic\npurposes, you might want to show that. Okay, fine. You know, this is your\nbig sequence. You need that. But for the rest of the animal,\nit's weirdly inaccurate, and I don't think the\npublic would know and they might well care if it\nwas much more accurate. And I don't think it would be any harder\nto make it accurate than to make it inaccurate. I've spoken to a\ncolleague of mine who I won't name, just in case I get him into trouble. who's a big dinosaur nerd, but\nalso a big creature creator and designer, and has done a\nwhole bunch of proper Hollywood A-list movie stuff. And I\nasked him about this, and I went, \"Okay, but, like,\nis it just easier to take the model that you've got and mess\naround with it than to, if I came in and said, 'You need to fix that, and you need to fix\nthis, you need to fix this, you need to fix that?'\" And he basically went, \"No, it's about\nthe same amount of effort.\" It's not like we don't have the director or the producer or\nthe lead designer going, \"No, I want that arm a bit longer. I want that tail a bit brighter.\nCan you add a few more bits there? I don't like those scales.\" So he said, \"We're\ndoing that constantly anyway. So doing it to one set of design specs versus\nanother set of design specs is no more hassle.\" In other words, he said, \"It's\nno harder to make it accurate than to make it inaccurate.\" And it's like,\nif that's truly the case, then just make it right. And then\nyou can claim a level of accuracy and engagement that you can.\nI mean, it's interesting. There's a thing called the Jurassic\nFoundation. After the first Jurassic Park made an absolute fortune. I think it was\nSpielberg directly, may have been through Universal, but anyway, they set up the\nJurassic Foundation, and it's a small fund of money for research on dinosaurs and related\nanimals, and academics can apply for it. One of my PhD students got\nsome money from the Jurassic Foundation. That's great. He\ndidn't have to do that. He went, \"Paleontology's helped give me this. I'm\ngoing to give back a bit.\" And after what must be, what, 30 years now, it's\nprobably funded an awful lot of research and helped young researchers get a start. So there's a level of engagement\nthere that I think hasn't been in subsequent films,\nwhich you can kind of see once it goes from being\na one-off to being a franchise, and it's changed hands. I mean,\nhow many different directors has it had now? You know, Spielberg\ndid the first two, and then don't know about the next five.\nMust be two, if not another three more people, you know, and 30 years\nlater, it's all changing. - Yeah, but that's the path of\ncreating a legendary film. The depth of accuracy, and it's not that\ndifficult to work, but it's also... It does something to the\nwhole artistic creation if you create a culture where the\ndetails really, really matter. - Matter. Yeah, and again, there\nare some oddities, so like Gallimimus, I mentioned it earlier, so one\nof the ornithomimosaurs. The model for gallimimus in Jurassic World is nearly identical to that from Jurassic Park.\nOne of the differences, which you can barely see on film, but I\nknow this is true because I found it in like, a Jurassic World kids book\ncause I flicked through it when it came out, is a closeup of the head with an arrow to\nthe teeth. Gallimimus doesn't have teeth. It's got a beak. So someone\nhas taken the original model and actively spent time adding\nteeth to an animal that didn't have them. I would understand it. I'm\nnot saying I agree with it, but I'd understand if it was a rule of cool\nand like, \"Yeah, but it would look so much better with all these gnarly big teeth\nand whatever.\" And it's like, you can't even see it in the final thing. They've got\ntiny little heads. In the film, all they do is like, run past the camera\nbriefly. It's not like they're a big carnivore and they're engaged in like,\none of the big battles. Like, why? Why? It's not like... You can\nbarely even see them. - Well, yeah, again, just to linger\non it. There is a lot of value to authenticity in all walks\nof life, and one of them is ...accuracy. When you're talking\nabout dinosaurs, it's so valuable and so worthy, and it's respectable\nfor the long life of a film to be accurate. I just wish, I hope they do that.\nThere are certain directors that really dogmatically push that. Alex\nGarland comes to mind. You know, he did, whenever he integrates quantum\ncomputing or AI into a film... - Mm-hmm. Nolan with the\nblack hole in Interstellar. ...ended up publishing a paper on\nthe calculation to visualize that. - I mean, that's legendary. - Yeah. - That's great. That's really... And like, you think that has nothing to do with\nthe story, the narrative of the film, but it does. It, like, permeates everything. If\nyou get that black hole right, that... ...everybody else steps up\ntheir game, and really, really tells a story in this way that\nreverberates through time, and it, like, really moves people. So, - Yeah. I, I, yeah, I mean,\nas I say, I, I wish it was better. I mean, the only thing I'd\nflip it around is a joke I've made more than once, but like, just\ndon't take it as a documentary. No one watches James Bond and goes, \"That's\nhow international espionage works.\" You know, he's got the laser watch\nand the exploding car, and he's like, maybe treat it a bit as fiction.\nI've heard from a friend of mine who worked at the Royal Tyrrell Museum,\nwhich I've mentioned before, in Alberta, which is an absolutely\nphenomenal place, and she said after the first one,\ngenuinely, like, it was not common, but more than\nonce, people were annoyed that they didn't have the real dinosaurs\nout back, because they'd seen them, and they knew that the real ones were\nout there. Which is a testament to Industrial Light & Magic and\nStan Winston, but also... - Wow. - ...slightly horrifying that\nanyone watched Jurassic Park and literally thought that. Also, why would\nyou go to a museum? You go to the zoo if it's alive. - There you will also meet what\nis it, King Kong and Godzi- I don't think we quite touched on\nthis. I really want to ask you about intelligence. What we know about ...the intelligence of, let's say, T-Rex. We\ntalked about his big head. What do we know about- - Not much. So there's a T-Rex brain, or at\nleast a very rough cast of part of one. - That's the actual look of- - Yeah, this is ...so dinosaurs, in fact, most reptiles.\nI don't know if you can see it on the velociraptor. Not really,\nunfortunately. Um- - It's elongated. - Yeah, but it's more that\nthey have... we are weird in that we have a brain that\nbasically fills the inside of our skull. What most animals have\nis actually a little kind of sub-skull inside the main\nskull, which is called the endocast or endocranium, and the\nbrain is in that. And even then, it's not, like, full of brain because we've\npacked an awful lot of brain into a limited space, and they then have quite a lot\nof goo and fat and other stuff around it. But it means for dinosaurs, and\nthen deep reptiles and birds in general, in the old days\nyou could basically cut one open, but now we'll CT scan through them,\nyou can take an internal mold of the endocranium or the brain\ncase, and then whatever filled that would've been the brain and\nits surrounding tissues. And that's how you get something like this. In this case,\nsomeone literally cracked open an old skull- ...and basically took an internal mold in the\nsame way that you do an external mold for the skulls. And that tells\nyou quite a lot about certain things. So for example,\nthey've got a bulb at the front, which is the olfactory bulb. So brains\nare very stereotyped, again, ours are super weird, so you have the olfactory bulb at the front\nand behind that you have the optic bulb or the optic lobe. So roughly how big\nthey are will tell you roughly how much of the brain is devoted to,\nfor example, sight and smell. So if it's a lot, it's pretty good. If\nthere's not much, it's not very good. That goes quite a long way already. One thing we've done in the last few\nyears is you can also get into the, it's not shown here, it wouldn't be\npart of this, but the inner ear. We can CT scan into the structure\nof the bony inner ear, and from that you can actually get an\nidea of what frequency of sounds the inner ear was structured\n...to be pitched to. - Wow. - Which doesn't actually tell you very\nmuch, but it's phenomenally cool that you can do it. - We should say you also have quite a bit of a\nbackground in biology. So you're trying to reconstruct biology from, go\nfrom paleontology to biology. - Yeah, my go-to one-liner\nis, \"I'm a zoologist but I work on dead stuff.\"\nMy degree was zoology. My official job title now is Reader of\nZoology. I teach zoology. I don't teach Paleo. So yeah, living animals was always actually my primary\ninterest, and I kind of fell into paleo, but then I wanted to drag\nthat with me because I'd been trained in behavior and ecology and it's what I\nwas most interested in, so then applying that knowledge and understanding\nto these animals. - So to some degree it is possible\nto reach towards the biology? - Absolutely, yeah. - So with the ear, that's\ninteresting. The brain. - Yeah. - So we can know something about the brain? - Yeah, but then when you get into\nintelligence is when it gets really awkward because working out exactly\nwhich bits of this are probably linked to, like, the main\nfundamental processing and what you'd link to actual\nintelligence is tough. On top of that, we don't really know what's been the\nbig challenge of the last couple of years of this question, was T-Rex and other dinosaurs\nsuper intelligent? Like, neuron density. How many basically\nnerve cells can you pack in per bit of volume? Because birds have some weird\ntricks which means they get a lot more brain per volume. Just how much of the brain case was brain and how\nmuch was, like, goop around it, we know varies, so you're getting\nkind of fairly big upper and lower band, and then the other big thing\nwe always have to do is factor in size. Big animals need bigger\nbrains to operate them. So whales have really big brains, but\nwhales weigh tens of tons. They're not smarter than us. So you have\nthe classic thing is a thing called the encephalization\nquotient, which is at a very simple level, it is the volume of brain\nscaled against the size of the animal. We have huge brains compared to how\nbig we are, so we're massively up the chart. And then you do have a few\nthings with, like, worms. I should probably stick to vertebrates, because there's\nsome stupid stuff which has a surprisingly small brain for\nits size. Most things that aren't primates, and things\nlike crows and parrots, sit very neatly on a couple of different curves.\nThere's a curve for reptiles, a curve for birds, a curve for mammals, and\nthings like this. And basically that's it. But also, actually,\nour understanding with mass estimates for dinosaurs is good but not great,\nand so you could easily be out by, you could easily be out by like\n20 or 30% on the volume of the brain inside the brain case, and then\nyou could be out by 20 or 30% on your mass estimate. Well,\nnow suddenly, it's very easy to make the brain too big\nand the animal too light and it's super smart, or make the brain too small\nand the animal too heavy and it's super dumb. So that's awkward, unfortunately. - So apparently there's a, some controversial\npaper that suggests that T-Rex is a pri- has primate-level intelligence. - Yeah, and then that was shot\ndown within a few months by a team of paleontologists and a couple\nof other neurologists who really went to town on it. - Just counting the number of... Trying\nto estimate the number of neurons. - Yeah, it was the neuron\ndensity thing, and yeah I've unsurprisingly support the revised one which was done by a whole bunch...\nYeah, the Casper paper. I've spoken to Casper about it, couple\nof the other authors. - So, they scaled down the number\nof neurons from three billion down to 250 million to 1.7 billion. - Yeah, much, much lower. - Which is similar to crocodiles\nand other primates. - Yeah, which is kind of what you'd expect.\nI mean, a couple of other people at various times have suggested they're\nreally smart. And again, you know, birds have this thing of, they have this\nweird thing of neuron folding, and they can basically pack in a lot more than you'd\nexpect. You know, that's why crows are that smart despite having tiny brains, relatively even\ncompared to their overall size. But I'm being obviously\noverly facetious, but if ultimately part of your scaling\nis how big is the animal versus how big is its brain,\nthat's most of a T-Rex brain. It's a fraction of the\nsize of a chimp brain, and chimps don't weigh seven tons. So, you know, it's a kind of\nHitchens-like extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence,\nbut you just look at it and go that's about the proportion we'd expect\nfor a croc. Now, crocs are smarter than people think, but they're\nsure as hell not monkeys. Um, you're going to have to really\ncome up with something much more convincing than, \"Oh well, if you just\npack 'em in, if you scale 'em this way.\" - A bit of a ridiculous question, but is it\npossible to find evidence of tool use? - I mean, in theory, it depends\nquite how you define a tool, so birds building nests is\narguably tool use to a certain degree. I'm aware of... I suspect it's turned\nout not to be the case. I was, I was shown a very rough, not\nvery well-prepared fossil 20 years ago now, no, 15 years\nago now, where someone said, \"We think this might be an early bird\nnest and therefore potentially even a dinosaur nest,\" and nothing's\never been published, so my guess is once they excavated it and had a good\nlook at it, they went, \"Nah, it's nothing really.\" I mean, I guess the\nquestion is, how would you know? - Yeah, it would be difficult unless it's\nobvious, widespread, primate-like... - Yeah, but even then, like, you know... - ...sapient-like almost. - Chimps make loads of tools, but it's mostly\nmade of wood, and they're mostly just breaking stuff, and then the\nodds of that preserving are very low. You do get things like\nchimps and otters, sea otters, you know, they have their favorite anvil\nand hammer stones to break stuff open. But again, the reason they picked that stone\nis 'cause it's really heavy and good at breaking oysters or breaking\nnuts. It's not gonna leave, or probably not gonna leave stereotypical\npoints on the rock. And even then, you could just go, \"Well,\nmaybe it, you know, just got bashed up in\na river or something.\" - So, in your book \"Uncovering Dinosaur\nBehavior,\" you conclude that there's a lot we might not know. What's\na particular lost behavior that we don't know about that\nyou think might be out there? - Something like midden use, so\na whole bunch of animals and birds who basically crap\nin the same spot. They have their spot, and that's where\nthey go. So, rabbits do this, sloths do this, aardvarks, even things like\nwildebeest and zebra, not zebra, impala will tend to go back to\nthe same place every day. But the fossil record of\nsarcoplites, fossilized feces and fossilized waste from dinosaurs,\nit exists, but it's extremely rough because of course, this is the stuff\nthat's already been digested and broken down. It's already kind of gooey and broken\nup and doesn't have a lot going for it. If they do it in water, it's going to\ndissipate instantly. If it rains, it's probably going to fall apart. Things like\ndung beetles and flies will break it down. Even if it gets covered by sand or\nwhatever from a sandstorm, it's probably still going to compress and separate.\nSo, are you ever going to find it? Maybe going back to our trackway stuff,\nbut even if you do, what species left that? We know a big\nherbivore did this, but was it Triceratops, or was it an Ankylosaur?\nThose animals are very different things doing very different things, and it would tell\nyou different things about their behavior - Yeah, so one piece of behavior\nI forgot to ask you about. So, T-Rex engaging cannibalism. - Yeah, almost certainly. Well,\ncertainly. I think we've got there's a T-Rex bone with a T-Rex\nembedded tooth in it. With overgrowth. I think it's, I want to say it's an\nAlbertosaur rather than T-Rex, but there is there is a tyrannosaur\njaw in Alberta with a T-Rex tooth stuck in it, and you\ncan pull the little tooth out. And then there's a T-Rex\nfoot bone with these distinctive feeding traces on them. And\nthis actually goes back to that early point about T-Rex being weird, being the\nonly big carnivore in its environment, because if this was even Mongolia at\nthat time, but anywhere else, there's three or four or five big carnivores.\nAnd so you find a bone and it's chewed up by a big carnivore, we don't\nknow who did it. But when you see a big bone chewed up in a T-Rex ecosystem, well, you know, if it's anything\nbigger than this, you know it was T-Rex. And so when it's a T-Rex\nbone with T-Rex bite marks, - Yep, it's pretty obvious. - QED. Yeah, so it must have been. - That's fascinating, isn't it? That they\nwould attack themselves, their own species. - Cannibalism turns up in a\nwhole bunch of stuff. Um, but it's very rare as like\na fairly habitual behavior. - So, but there's several reasons\nyou might be engaging in, or rather teeth marks might\ntell various stories. So it could be just fighting\nfor dominance, right? - It, it could, but it's unlikely, and in\nthis case, so again, we see there are loads of facial injuries in tyrannosaurs,\nin carnivorous dinosaurs generally, but particularly tyrannosaurs. They have\nreally beaten up heads, like half or even two-thirds of adults\nhave scarring and facial injuries. But you see healing on\nit, whereas this foot does not show healing and it's got multiple\ndifferent bites. The idea that you'd bite a foot whilst fighting someone\nand then go back and bite that one foot again? That's pretty unlikely. - So, looks like it's eating, not fighting. - Yeah, and they're more like the feeding scrape\ntraces than they are the big puncture wounds, so again, not impossible, but very\nweird for that to occur as a fight. - So fascinating. - So yeah, they're- they're fighting,\nthey're fighting probably quite a lot, but whether or not you actually\neat something that you've killed or that you stumble across as a\nbody, it definitely happens occasionally. Otherwise, we wouldn't have the record\nof that, but there's a reason carnivores often don't eat carnivores, and\nparticularly don't eat their own species, which is\nparasitism. Carnivores in general are loaded with parasites\nbecause they spend their whole lives eating food which has\nparasites and stuff in it. And so they tend to accumulate a lot\nof them. What's the one thing that's definitely gonna have the most parasites\nin it that can infect you as, for example, a lion? It's another lion\nthat eats the exact same stuff that you do. So whilst it is\nfood and particularly if you've just won a big fight,\nyou might want to eat. In general, cannibalism's\npretty rare because it's generally not a good idea if there's\nother food available. But yeah, if you're starving to death or, you know, the\nother guy ripped your leg half off and you don't think you're gonna walk for six weeks,\nnot that you'd think, but you know what I mean. Like, and now there's a body in front\nof you, it's two tons of meat, well, maybe you should tuck in. - This is so fascinating, like, once\nagain, figuring out this puzzle. And like, what does cannibalism tell\nyou? You're piecing together the story of T-rex, their life, their\nhunting life, their social life from their evolution to their biology to\ntheir behavior. That's so fascinating. - Yeah, we try to. But the thing is,\nit's always getting better which is So that's what I try to finish\non in my book on behavior is, I felt I'd written a couple\nof hundred pages of, \"We keep screwing this up, we've overstated this, I\nthink people have misunderstood this, this-\" You know, like the track ways stuff, and\nlike, this is not as confident as we think, you need to look at these alternate explanations.\nThis behavior shows that that behavior probably doesn't correlate the way you said it does, yada, yada,\nyada. And it's like, and now I feel like I've just written a book trashing my entire field and all\nmy colleagues, or at least many of my colleagues. And then, but then\nyou flip it on its head and going, \"We've got techniques\nthat were undreamed of ten years ago. We've got data\nstreams that were undreamed of ten years ago. And we've actually got\na much better understanding of living species.\" And then on top of that we're\njust constantly finding new animals, you you know, we have not just new species, which are often, I think, a lot\nless important, but just new specimens of ones we know, because again, it's building up that\ndatabase. You know, we drifted off talking about sexual selection, but like, yeah,\nif you want to know growth, one or two animals doesn't tell you how an\nanimal, a species, grows. 50 or 100 does. And then that reveals a hell of\na lot more about things like sexual dimorphism and growth rate and how vulnerable\njuveniles are and population structure and maybe how they're reproducing. So I'd like to think I knocked down, I think, a\nfew towers that probably a few people were fond of, but I think we have\nthe raw materials to build much better, stronger edifice of behavior. But as you say, it's always\ngoing to be based around often very piecemeal evidence and like possibilities and probabilities\nrather than certainties. - Let's talk about a sad topic: extinction. - Yep. - How did the dinosaurs go extinct? - Mostly, probably, pretty\nquickly, but it really is the answer that I think most people are now\nprobably familiar with, which is, it's an asteroid impact or some kind\nof extraterrestrial body hit just off the coast of the Yucatan\nPeninsula in Mexico about 66 million years ago that basically atomized the asteroid, but also importantly,\nthe bit of the ground it hit, or below the sea bed that it hit, was\nbasically the worst kind of rock. And so it put up this enormous\nash cloud and basically you have a nearly instantaneous\nnuclear winter. I mean, immediate devastation. You know,\nand anything immediately next to it is obviously just vaporized. But\nyou know, this is the sort of thing that's hot enough to set fire to the\natmosphere. I think the one I read was, it's something like a piece of rock\nabout the size of Mount Everest traveling at something like 10\ntimes the speed of sound. So just the momentum between that speed\nand mass thing is just, you know, beyond extraordinary. - But I think what does a lot of damage\nis the change in the climate, and- - Yeah, and so every... There\nare five recognized mass extinctions in the history of life on Earth, and\nall of them are ultimately some form of climate change, whether it's volcanic eruptions or hyper-oxygenation, or an ice\nage or whatever. It's climate changing too quickly for things to adapt\nto. And that starts, you know, that just cripples entire populations and\nentire species. And then if you do enough damage to enough things,\nyou start getting ecosystem collapse. You know, this moth has\ndied out. Well, it turns out that moth is the primary pollinator of this\ntree. Well, that tree produced nuts, and that was the entire winter survival store\nfor this squirrel. Well, that squirrel was the main food of this cat, and now suddenly the moth going has killed four other\nthings and everything that's attached to that. And so that's really what did for them. - And sadly, the big\nthings... Well, everything dies, but the big things have\na lot of trouble recovering. - Yeah. So, I mean, this\nis, you know, a classic example. So, oh well, you know, what is\npaleontology good for? Well, actually, really, it's extinction, which is very relevant\nright now in that we have a very good handle on when you have\nextreme climate stress, what tends to suffer more and what tends\nto suffer less. And as we say, big things fundamentally\ndo. They require more resources, they require more\narea of land. You need to roam further, which means, you know,\nif you're a mouse and you happen to have a little bit of land and that bit\ndoesn't get hit, you're fine; whereas if you're an elephant and you need all of this\nland and even a chunk of it goes wrong, well, that's probably maybe not\nenough for you to survive anymore. So, yeah, big things suffer disproportionately\nbadly from these things, and mostly as well we think terrestrial\nthings generally do worse than things in water because\nwater's a great equilibrating medium, you know, it takes ages\nto heat up, it takes ages to cool down. Yes, if you live in specific\ncoastal conditions or something, maybe you can't travel that easily,\nbut, you know, whales can go from pole to pole quite happily, and plenty\nof other fish do too. So if it's too hot or too cold or too nasty here,\nyou can just swim somewhere else, whereas if you're an animal and you hit a\ndesert or you hit a mountain range or you hit a river, you stop moving and you're\ntrapped, and then you die. So dinosaurs were, yeah,\nthe worst possible combination. They were mostly\nbig and they were mostly on land, and yeah, it's not really\nsurprising they did very badly out of it. - And then some species did survive. I guess I think you've said that it's\nvery possible that some dinosaurs even survived for a time. - Oh, w- - ...that we might be able\nto discover down the line. - I'd be amazed if they didn't. I mean,\nthere's been various reports over the decades of the- the K-Pg or K-T extinction, the Cretaceous-\nPaleogene or Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction of dinosaurs surviving\nand none of them have held up. It's usually been bioturbation,\nso literally things like prairie dogs digging, and of course they'll\ndig a tooth up and then move it through the layers, or things like this,\nor plant roots can move stuff. Or just soils can get churned up. But I would be shocked if they\ndidn't. Not like, \"Oh, yeah, the dinosaur survived, and the Loch Ness\nMonster, and stuff like that.\" But like, yes, it was a global devastation.\nYes, it's what ultimately killed the dinosaurs, but I'd be amazed if there\nwasn't some equivalent of Hawaii or New Zealand or some other tucked\naway island or valley where actually dinosaurs were fine for anything\nfrom a few hundred thousand to a couple of million years. But on\na global scale, it's a dot on a map and the odds that we'll ever uncover any rocks, fossiliferous rocks\nof that age that we then have access to that we then find a dinosaur\nin that we can then date properly, I think, is almost non-existent.\nBut it would just be weird if they didn't survive somewhere for a bit,\nor even quite a few of them in places. - So a small, local population. - We see it all the time, you\nknow, the lemurs in Madagascar, all the stuff in New Zealand. There's tons\nof weird archaic stuff hanging around. in Hawaii, you know, Galapagos\nfinches and tortoises, the tortoises that you don't see anywhere else.\nIn Australia, with the marsupials, they're almost, and then the monotremes are\nalmost unknown outside of there. This is a pretty normal bit of biology.\nFor animals that were so dominant globally we know there were patches that were largely\nunchanged, otherwise we wouldn't have had the mammals surviving and the crocodiles surviving and\nthe birds surviving and ever- and newts and frogs and everything that did\nsurvive. I'm sure a few of those patches had some dinosaurs in them,\nbut it is ultimately what killed them. - What do you think is the chance that they\nwould have survived? So you take some local populations and they flourish. - It's happened. Look at\nAustralia. You know, the marsupials have done pretty\nwell there for a very long time. You can imagine if the next mass extinction, you know,\nflattens a large chunk of Indonesia, for example,\nkangaroos could island hop pretty easily, make\nit to mainland Asia. - But then, I mean, to then\nlead... You take the dinosaurs... a small fraction\nsurvives and then they eventually repopulate the earth again. - I mean, that's extraordinarily unlikely, because\nonce your population's been crashed like that, you do have the problems of\nthings like inbreeding, or maybe you're a great specialist to a certain area,\nor you're surviving because you're isolated, you're in a valley, or\nyou're on an island, and then dispersing again becomes really,\nor breaking out into those areas becomes much, much harder. - So like the great predators like the...\nEven though the T-rex is such a great predator, that doesn't give you... - Yeah, because you still had\nthe extinction event, and the environment is no longer what\nit was that you evolved into. - Right. - And once those systems start to recover,\nthose other animals are going to adapt much better to them. - How does that make you feel that, that\nthis stupid asteroid from nowhere? - Well, I mean, at one level I probably\nwouldn't be here if it hadn't. - So, I mean, that's an interesting question. I mean,\ndo you think... There's several ways of asking that question, but if dinosaurs\ndidn't go extinct, do you think humans would still be able to evolve? - I mean, my guess is probably\nnot. I don't think it's quite the... What was it? Oh, Simon Conway Morris had that book. What was it?\nInevitability of Man. That like even if you rewound it, everything\nwould come back. I'm not... I don't think it's that far.\nI certainly don't think it's anything quite like the butterfly\neffect of, you know, if one mammal had been trodden on by one\nT-rex, then humans would never have evolved either. - We should say that the ancestor\nof the primates, or the closest... There's a lot of debate\naround this, it's a kind of tiny creature, Purgatorius, that was our ancestor. Yeah, so this is us.\nThis is what we evolved from. - Yes. Scandentia, I think, is the group. - Basically a rodent. - Yeah, I mean there were probably\nprimates around in the Cretaceous. Some of the molecular clock stuff\nsuggests that primates were around alongside the dinosaurs,\nbut we've never found any osteological evidence of that.\nBut yeah, there's been a back and forth about were dinosaurs already\non their way out, or were they a bit limited by the very end Cretaceous.\nI think the more recent analyses have shown that's probably not the case,\nbecause in other words, they were basically doing fine right up to the\nextinction event. And so, yeah, if the asteroid hadn't hit, there's\nno reason to think that they were on some kind of terminal decline. Something\nelse may have hit. There may have been, you know, some other environmental\ndisaster or something may have happened, or maybe they're more vulnerable\nto stuff than we know of, but there's no... I don't think there's\nany really good reason to think they wouldn't have carried on\nrelatively well. I mean, even post-dinosaur extinction, you had a window\nwhere the mammals and the birds were pretty competing. There was a lot of\nbig birds getting going and various big carnivorous, terrestrial,\nkind of hyper-predatory ostrich-like things, like the\nphorusrhacids. So there's no guarantee that mammals would have\neven taken over post the dinosaur extinction, since initially they\nwere in a fair bit of competition. - So is it just going to... Based on current\nscientific understanding, human evolution would be highly improbable if dinosaurs hadn't\ngone extinct 66 million years ago, because dinosaurs dominated\necological niches. - For everything, basically. - Wide-bodied mammals. - I mean, that's the thing. You look\nthrough the Mesozoic, the late Triassic, dinosaurs are there\nalongside a whole bunch of other big and unusual and interesting\nreptiles and some other early pre-mammal-like things that are\ncloser to mammals than the reptiles. But once you've gotten into the\nJurassic, you've now got a solid like 120, 130 million years where almost\nanywhere on Earth, if you saw an animal bigger than like a raccoon, it was\nprobably a dinosaur. That's how incredibly dominant they... You know,\nas dominant, if not more dominant than modern mammals. - But is it fair to say that\nthey were mostly dumb? - I don't think so, 'cause I\nthink that comes down to A) that bit of kind of\nclassic, almost Victorian speciesism, and you get\nthese insane hypotheses like dinosaurs as a species or as\na lineage became senile, so they forgot to breed. I know it's\nliterally a suggested idea. You know, the mammals ate their eggs and all\nof this kind of stuff. Dinosaurs only lived alongside mammals for 100 million years. It'd\nbe weird if they all went extinct at the same time because suddenly egg\neating evolved. You know, you've got problems like this. But\nalso, again, that general speciesism, which, you know, even goes\nback to Linnaeus and his taxonomic ranks, and even arguably stuff like\nAristotle, you've got like, you know, humans are superior in some\nway and we're superior to the other mammals. And of course, mammals\nare closest to us, so they must be quite good. And then they've got to be\nbetter than lizards, and then lizards have to be better than frogs, and\nfrogs have to be better than fish. So that gets you into the, \"Well, reptiles\nmust be stupid.\" And they're not. - I wonder if a human intelligence level\norganism could have evolved from the dinosaurs. - I mean, it's... That's been hypothesized\nplenty of times. Dale Russell, a Canadian paleontologist, the famous\nguy who came up with this human-like troodontid that was done for a TV documentary. I think the one that\nChristopher Reeve narrated. That, I think is a remake, but I've seen the original\nthat Dale had made for his TV show and it's still... It's sitting\nin the collections of the National Museum of Nature in\nOttawa, for Canada. It's really, really cool. It's like this five-foot tall\ndinosauroid. That was it there on the screen. - \"Model of the hypothetical dinosauroid and\ndisplay at the dinosaur museum in Dorchester.\" - Oh, Dorchester. That's in England. Yeah, I\nknew there were a couple of copies of it. Troodon always comes back as the most intelligent\ndinosaur because it has really quite a big brain for its size. It does\nhave a high encephalization quotient, so it's always been\ntagged as a very good candidate for being the smartest dinosaur. And\nbasically, he just hybridized that with a human. But of course, why would\nthese things end up as plantigrade quadrupeds, and why would they go back to five fingers\nand... Actually, I think he's only got three, to be fair, but he's got very human-like feet.\nWhy has it got no tail? Why would those things suddenly disappear? There's no\nreal reason other than just kind of human exceptionalism. But like, I mean, you\ncould argue some parrots, some crows are phenomenally intelligent\nand show extremely clever behaviors on par with apes. So at some level, some dinosaurs\nwere extremely intelligent. - I mean, yeah, this is a whole other\nconversation, but all the tiny details that lead to the explosion that\nis in our evolutionary tree that is Homo sapiens. Like\nwhat is it? Opposable thumbs, right? Is it the invention of\nfire and the meat-eating? Is it- ... is it some other- - And fighting and sociality and- - So many- - predation pressure, and then the changing\nenvironment. I mean, the shrinking of the forest, pushing apes out of the\ntrees into the environment, or into the open environment. - And probably the same kind of story could be\ntold about the dinosaurs or about anything really. - Yeah, I mean, you... - There's no reason... - I mean, if you have 160\nmillion years and a global domination. But I mean, this is the thing.\nYou talked about lost behaviors, but like the lost lineages. I wrote about this\nin one of my books, and like, you want to find... You want a weird\nanimal, you go to a volcanic island. You go to New Zealand,\nyou go to Hawaii, you go to the Galapagos, and yet those are the places\nthat basically don't really form fossils. So you think the dinosaurs we\nknow about are strange. What was the stuff knocking around\nthere? We're never going to know, sadly. But for everything you think weird... You know, you think birds are\ncool. Think about penguins compared to your average bird. They live on an ice shelf\nfor six months of the year and can't fly, and massively modified skeletons.\nYou know, compared to your average bird, penguins are unbelievably\nweird. So yeah, take an average dinosaur and take it to\npenguin level or ostrich level or hummingbird level evolution. There's going to be weirder stuff out\nthere than we've found. Much weirder. - If you travel back in time, your mind\nwill probably be blown by the weirdness. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Because those things are almost\nalways in small, isolated places that don't preserve fossils\nvery well, and so the odds of us ever coming across them... I mean,\nyou see it to a degree. So you've got, the stuff that comes out of\nwhat is modern Transylvania, what was Transylvania Hateg. That's that was a series of islands in the\nMediterranean at the end of the Cretaceous, and some of the weirdest dinosaurs\nare from that chain of islands. And that's not very isolated compared to,\nagain, something like Hawaii or New Zealand. But it's fitting the exact\npattern. You get dinosaurs on islands, they turn weird. We see that.\nSo again, dinosaurs were real animals. Again, it sounds really painfully obvious,\nbut they weren't monsters. They followed the same... Rules might be pushing\nit, but certainly, like, guidelines. Ecology operates in certain ways.\nIf you're bigger, you need more food. But you're more efficient.\nYou just are. That's pretty much just physics and scaling. So\nbig dinosaurs are going to follow the rules of bigger animals, and small dinosaurs\nare going to follow the rules of smaller animals. They just will. Quite how\nthey violate it in certain ways, by having unusually long necks or unusual physiology, or eating an\nunusual diet, or because there was a weird plant that was alive then that\nisn't now, or whatever it may be. There's obviously a huge amount of\nvariation and uncertainty. But fundamentally, we know what\nmakes animals and ecosystems work, and dinosaurs were\nanimals in ecosystems. They're not that strange at some level, and therefore\nreconstructing their actual biology is challenging, but far from impossible. - Strange question. As everybody\nknows, dragons are obviously real. - I've been asked that on live TV before.\nOnly not with the sarcastic tone, so... - Do you dare disagree? ...with this notion? - Yes, I do. They don't. - Well... - And again, I... - They're real to me, so... - That's fine. But again, you know,\nwe kind of touched on it, but I think there's probably\nvery little of any kind of paleontological law that ended up in things like Chinese culture, with the Chinese\ndragons and all of that stuff. That one comes up repeatedly. The only one I do\nknow of, again, from Alberta, is buffalo stones that the... apparently some of the Native Americans\nhad, which are actually bits of ammonites. So ammonites,\nthey're curly, spiral-shelled cephalopods that are related to octopus\nand squid. So they have all these little segments to the shells, and the\nright species... And when they break open, they have, like, two\nlittle pairs of legs and then a bulge and then a little bulge,\nand it looks very roughly like a bison. And apparently these were thought to be, like, somehow\nminiature bison. They're very rare because ironically, although the\ndinosaur bones are extremely common, it was very swampy, so you didn't\nactually have a lot of sea coming in, so you didn't tend to get things like ammonites\nand ocean-going animals. And then the shell would have to break in the right way. But\napparently for the local tribes, like Sáptəṉilh, I don't remember who it is in\nthat bit of Canada... But yeah, these were quite valued. If you've got a\nbuffalo stone. And I've seen a couple of them, and yeah, you have to squint\na bit, but as a little buffalo, it's not far off. But yeah, but that\nwhole, like, were they finding mammoth legs and were they\nfinding T-rexes, and was this inspiration for this animal or this mystical\nanimal? I don't think they were, because you just don't tend\nto find them like that. - So where do you think, like... You know, 'cause\ndragons show up in a bunch of different myths. - Well, right. But that's the thing, they turn up\nin British mythology, and we've barely got any dinosaurs here at all. You only find\nthem when you start digging for coal mines, which we weren't doing in... - Is it basically a dramatization of like of\nsnakes and lizards and stuff like this? - Yeah, and just general exaggeration\nand welding stuff together. I mean, that's one thing you could,\nI guess, potentially argue is that, you know, yeah, we find\ntyrannosaurs in North America and in East Asia. In fact, there's a whole bunch of stuff in\nthe Early Cretaceous, which is often very common, 'cause it's all relatively recent in the\ngrand scheme of things in the history of the world. The fauna of East Asia: China, Mongolia, Eastern Russia, is very\nsimilar to what you get in Canada or in the USA and down in Mexico. And so you find the same rough stuff. They may\nnot be exactly the same, but you get ceratopsians, you get tyrannosaurs, you\nget the big-edged archosaurs, you get ankylosaurs, the armored ones,\nthis, that, and the other. So if these were influencing all\nthose different cultures— ...why don't Chinese dragons\nlook like Mexican dragons or equivalent thunderbirds or whatever? Well,\nbecause it probably wasn't influencing them. If they were all seeing the\nsame skeleton, they'd probably all produce the same kind of mythical\nanimals. They all produce— - Well, uh— - ...different ones. - You have to understand, paleontology's not\nperfect, so they were just misinterpreting it. - Misinterpreting, yeah. - I mean, dragons aside, I'm sure, like\nwe said with weirdness, there would be creatures that would be remarkable, right? That\nyou look at it and you might as well be seeing a dragon. It could be— And I mean, there are creatures\nalive in the sea today. - Yeah, I mean if you dredged up a\ncolossal squid, I think you'd have— You know, or even just dugongs and manatees.\nI mean, they're really quite strange. - And if you allow yourself to marvel at the\nsmall things on Earth, like I was in the Amazon jungle, like the insects,\nthey're just like, \"What is—\" ...happening there? There\nare so many things going on. Oh, they're like hairy and\ncolorful, and probably poisonous, and they have teeth, and what?\nAnd they're just— And they're long and— - Well, and all the little\nweirdos. I've, I've— several times I've pitched a book to\npublishers where I want to write a book that basically makes the\npoint that there is almost nothing— I mean, you can always dream up\nsomething totally ludicrous— There is basically nothing in science fiction that doesn't\nalready exist on Earth in some way, shape, or form. - Yeah, that is why I'll think about alien\ncivilizations and aliens out there, and I'm very, very certain that\nthere are aliens everywhere throughout the observable universe.\nIt's very strange we haven't seen them, but it's fun to marvel at what they possibly look like, because\nthere's a huge variety of organisms and species here on\nEarth, and you just expand that out— ...to like more and more Earths, and you\ncan just imagine there's a lot of weird— - Well, that's the thing. I think most\npeople, you know, understandably... I'm a biologist, and I particularly\npride myself on finding out about particularly weird animals. But yeah,\nI think people would be stunned about some of the weird stuff that's\nout there that they just wouldn't realize are real. You know,\nthings like velvet worms. You know, it's just, it'll\nblow your mind. You know, caecilians and stuff like this and\ntheir reproductive behavior. It's just jaw-dropping. I mean, I love teaching\nabout them. I do a class on diversity of life, and it's about eight weeks of\nvertebrate diversity, and I love just dropping things in, and the students\nare like, \"What do you mean that exists? What do you mean something like that's\nnormal for this group?\" Yeah, they do that. - Well, what from that class, but\neverything you've studied with the dinosaurs, what have you learned about the evolution of life on\nEarth, that mechanism? - It's really good. It sounds\nobvious, but it's... I think the bit that still fries my brain is\njust like the raw numbers, because I think we're very bad at\nconsidering... Like, I regularly talk about, \"Oh, this is 70 million\nyears old, but this is 78, and this is 104.\" And people are just like, \"Oh\nmy God, how on Earth do you deal with those numbers?\" And I don't.\nThey're just numbers, because I can't conceive of\nit really any better than you can. They are astronomical. Yeah, last\nThursday was quite a long time ago. 66 million years is\nmind-boggling. I can't fathom it. I can't fathom it. But that's it. I think the evolution thing is, A, my\nsuspicion is quite a lot of it happens... It's not quite Stephen Gould's\npunctuated equilibrium, but I think stressful events probably\nprompt a lot more than less stressful events. You know,\npopulation crashes and all these things that then... Odd things survive, and then that's changing\nyour genetic component and all the rest of it. But you've just got to remember\nthat it's almost a numbers game. You know, it's that bad\nanalogy of like, \"Oh yeah, evolution is just rolling dice and hoping you get all\nsixes.\" And it's like, no, a friend of mine said, \"No, it's rolling dice, but it gets to keep\nthe sixes.\" And then suddenly getting a hat full of sixes isn't that hard,\nbut also you're in the context of even rare species,\nyou know, ultra-rare, short of stuff that like we've\nnearly killed off, but very rare species have populations in the\nthousands or hundreds of thousands. And are probably around for\nhundreds of thousands of years. Very few, other than a few\nthings like whales and apes and elephants, mostly have dozens\nor thousands of offspring at a time. So a few thousand animals\nthat have a few thousand offspring aligned for a few hundred\nthousand years... Yeah, it's billions and billions and billions\nof them. And that's the rare stuff. You look at Mola\nmola, the ocean sunfish, though I think Mola has just been split up into\nlike five species. It's one of the weirdest-looking animals. I\nlove it, love it, love it. I mean, what a fish that is.\nSwims with a giant dorsal and I think it's a giant anal fin,\nand then they flap alternatingly. - Does it have a face? Yeah. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Little one at\nthe front. Ate jellyfish. Super open-oceanic. And they get really big.\nYou can see that one with the diver. But I think these are the record breeders for\nanimals, and they have something like 100 million eggs at a time. - Whoa. - Don't quote me on that, but it is\nsomething in those kinds of numbers. So yeah, you don't need a\nvery large population of sunfish to start having an awful lot of numbers. Are you gonna\nGoogle it and see if you can find it? Number of eggs or something?\nYeah. 300 million. Oh, I under- I- - A single fe- - I undercut it. - A single female can release up to 300\nmillion eggs at one time during a spawning event. Boy. These eggs\nare incredibly small, measuring about 1.3 millimeters in diameter. - That's still a lot of egg\nsize when you think about it. - It's not that small. - Yeah. 300 million of one\nmil is still quite a bit. - Fertilization is external. - Yeah, it's- - Females release their eggs into the\nwater, where males then fertilize them. Wow. Man, there's a lot of different\nways to have sex, I guess. This is- - Yeah. But that's the\nbit of evolution that I think, I understand why\npeople don't get it. We are mostly talking about\nmillions in population times millions of years times\nthousands of offspring. Yeah. It's kind of a numbers game.\nWell, how could this evolve? With the right selective pressure, and\nwhen you've got 100 billion offspring, probably a few of them have that. - And when you focus in on a single\nspecies and trace its history, you can see how effective evolution is, natural\nselection is. And then you just have to, like, go across species\nand you're gonna realize- - Yeah, but it's also a massive compromise,\nwhich is the bit that people always miss. You know, it's Darwin's\nline, \"It's descent with modification.\" Yes, over\ntime, you can end up with extraordinarily weird things, but\nmostly what's happening is you're changing something fairly simple. - Yeah. - You're making edits to the existing plan, which is why you don't have\nanimals with tentacles. They have legs, which have joints, which\nhave fingers, and they all have one bone, then two bones, then a bunch of little\nblocky bones, and then a few more, and then the little ones that make up the digits for\nhands and feet, and basically everything has that- ... because you're modifying that pattern.\nAnd occasionally you'll get something weird, like most of the modern lungfish have\nbasically reduced those down to- well, they had a more simple plan to begin with, but\nreduced it down to a stump, and then they've got something like a flaily tentacle. But yeah, you know, snakes have gotten rid of them, all\nof the various legless lizards and things like that, and again, caecilians, and all\nthe rest. But yet, you're- you're subtly changing certain things in certain\nways is mostly what's going on, and then those build up over time. But also,\nagain, it's that compromise of there's things that do and don't work. There's\nthings that are interlinked, so you can't modify A without modifying\nB. Modifying A will kill you, therefore B never modifies,\nbecause the two are genetically linked in some way. Or yeah,\nlike the compromise of the lion's mane. Making it darker makes you\nsexier, but more likely to kill you. I think people think evolution is like, perfecting things in some way.\nAnd they're not. They're bodge jobs, you know? That's why we\nhave a blind spot in our eye, but things like squid don't. - But that process, nevertheless, does have\ninventions in it. You have Tiktaalik. You have a fish that learns to\nbreathe, that crawls out. - Yeah, but it already had a swim bladder that\nit was probably processing a minimal amount of oxygen through, and the swim bladder\nevolved for a certainly different function. - Yeah, but that's one of the powerful\nthings... ...About evolution. ... evolution. It switches the function. It develops it for one function, but once you\nonce you get there, you're like, \"Oh, okay, this could be used for another function,\"\nthat- that leads to something that we, in retrospect, can see as\na major invention, which is- ... a fish that's able to crawl\non land, and all of a sudden- - Yep, absolutely. - ...we have- we have cities and... ...And\nrockets, and yeah. Tiktaalik specifically, like, there's something really,\nlike, mind-boggling about a fish that crawls out of the sea,\nand you just the image of that. - Yeah, but again, you've got stuff that's\nnot a million miles away from that. You have things like frogfish,\nwhich are fully marine, but kinda clamber through\nseaweed and stuff, and they've got pseudo-functional limbs.\nIt's again, it's that ...Tiktaalik is not a weirdly\nderived frogfish, but it's not like it's a fish that suddenly came on land or a fish\nthat suddenly evolved legs. There was already that selective pressure that was pushing it\ninto a new opportunity, which gave it an- and then on and on and on, and that's what keeps\ngoing. But it also brings up another thing, going back to dinosaurs and the behavior\nstuff, which, again, I think has been a problem, is the functionality thing, and how there's always been,\nI think, this big perception of single traits having single functions, which isn't how a huge amount of biology\nworks. For some, yeah. Like, eyes are used for seeing. They don't\nreally do anything else. But I think there's a lot of- again, it comes down to a\nlot of the sexual selection stuff, but things like horns on Triceratops. That's probably quite\ngood for fighting off predators, but it's also quite good for\nfighting other Triceratops. And then things like elephants dig with their\ntusks as well as fight other elephants, as well as fight lions, as well as\nstripping the bark off trees. So, you've got to be very careful about\nhow you think of functionality in two different ways. One way\nis, what possible things could that thing do and\nwhat possible things could have been the main selective\npressure before. So, you think about elephant tusks. As I say, they do all these\ndifferent things. But when an elephant's just got the tiniest- little nubs, like the first elephant\nwhose teeth are growing the wrong way and have pushed out of its jaw,\nand now it's got a couple of little spikes, it can't really dig a hole with them. It's certainly not\ndigging for water. They're probably not great against a predator, because you'd\nbasically have to get on your knees to try and lean over and try and stab it a bit.\nBut you can show off to the girls, and you can immediately find another elephant\nwho's head-to-head the same height as you, and you've got a\nmassive advantage. So, evolutionarily, they probably\nstarted as some kind of sexually selected feature. But now, functionally, they are probably\ncompromised by the fact that having the best fighting tusks, but\nalso having the tusks that are best at digging up water to keep\nyou alive during a drought, is putting selective pressure on that. And those are, are those selections,\nsexual selection appears in both ends. Those are two different\nthings. Digging for water is critical, but it's probably not what\nstarted it. And I think that's where we get trapped with things like, say, the paddle tail of Spinosaurus\nor stuff like, or you know, or T-rex arms. It's like, well, why are T-rex\narms like that? Well, maybe we need to consider what a slightly longer arm is\nlike or what it was being functioned for in its ancestors or how it works in other\nspecies or what else it might do, rather than every paper is\nlike, \"Did it do this,\" or, \"Did it do this,\" or, \"Did it do this?\" It's\nlike, you know, it could be all of them. That's- a very different question to try and answer,\nbut people don't tend to think of it. And it ends up being very binary.\nAnd again, biology is not like that, because it's a compromise. - And it may be wiser to then look at\nthe evolutionary origins, how it first sprung up. - Yeah, if you, yeah. You know, what does a miniaturized version of this look like,\nand what might that function for? Or, how does it function in ancestral forms?\nYou know, a really good example of that is giraffe necks, which have been argued\nabout, you know, forever and a day. It was, \"Giraffe necks are to help them\nfeed up high.\" And then in the late '90s, early 2000s, there's a couple of papers\ncoming out going, \"Actually, maybe it's sexual selection and competition.\"\nAnd then that drove down into arguments about, \"Well, what does a short\nneck look like? And the okapi is the nearest relative. And what do short legs look like, and\nhow do they work?\" And plus a whole bunch of other studies. And ultimately, it came out that\nwe were right the first time. This is all about feeding. But it's a really interesting way\nof thinking about it and looking at it. - Gotta ask you the ridiculous question. We\ndo have dinosaurs here on Earth today. They're birds. - Yep. 10 and a half, 11,000\nspecies of dinosaur. - Are birds dinosaurs? - Yes. - Yeah, there's not... - It's, it's- - Wild? - It's just a yes. Yeah. - How many people know this, by the way? - So there's, there's an interesting one.\nI did a radio show, oh, it's probably seven or eight years ago now, with a\ncouple of prese- you know, drive time afternoon, nothing serious, nothing science, or\nanything like that. I mentioned something like this. And one presenter was, \"Oh my God,\nwhat do you mean birds are dinosaurs?\" And the other one is, \"What do you mean\nyou don't know birds are dinosaurs?\" So it's hitting that tipping point of\ncommon knowledge, I think, where... Does everyone know? No. But I think an awful\nlot of people know and are now used to it. as an idea. - So what's the evolutionary connection\nbetween birds and dinosaurs? - They literally are, in the same way\nthat we are apes and mammals. Birds are dinosaurs. The direct,\nif you trace back the evolution of all the\nbirds, so hummingbirds and albatross and ostrich and kiwi and\nparrots and pelicans and penguins and whatever else, and take them down\nto their ancestral point, and then go back quite a few more\nmillion years, the nearest relatives to them is a dinosaur. It\nis actually something very close to Velociraptor or at least a\nsmall version of Velociraptor. So birds have literally descended\nfrom dinosaurs, therefore they are dinosaurs. We have literally\ndescended from other apes, we are apes. It is that form of\nevolutionary connection. - Throughout that whole process, did they\nhave feathers, or did feathers come and go? - Feathers are in tyrannosaurs.\nFeathers go back at least... So, ironically, because the fossil record\nis very incomplete, most of the things that are closest to birds we know\nfrom the early and late Cretaceous, so the last kind of 50 million\nyears of dinosaur evolution, up to the extinction. And actually,\nbirds almost certainly go back another 50 million years. So birds did not appear\nas a result of the dinosaurs going So birds did not appear as a\nresult of the dinosaurs going extinct. Birds lived alongside the dinosaurs\nfor 100 million years. This was, the birds were not new on the scene. It's not\nlike, \"Oh, the dinosaurs died, and from the ashes rose the birds.\" No,\nthey've been knocking around forever. No, they've been knocking around forever. - They just survived 'cause they're small. - In a very large part, yeah. That's\nalmost certainly what really helped them. Birds took a\nkicking in the KT extinction. So did mammals. Loads of bird lineages went\nextinct, and only a handful got over the line, but they did. We have feathers,\nas I said, we've got Middle Jurassic tyrannosaurs that are 165 million years. old, so 100 million years before\nthe extinction, that have feathers. Simple feathers, they'd be\nlike those you get on most baby chicks, so they're not with the big kind of classic pick up a feather in, you know,\nin the street or on a field, the big vein up the middle and then the kind\nof paired flat pieces. This would be much more like a\nhair. But we have them. We've got something which is very close\nto a bird, but might not quite be a bird, with modern feathers. In the Middle Jurassic, we've got definitive\nstuff like Archaeopteryx in the Late Jurassic, and then into the early Cretaceous\nwe have a series of fossil beds in China which are just heaving\nwith them. So yeah, and tyrannosaurs have feathers.\nVelociraptor and the Dromaeosaurs had feathers. Troodontids\nhad feathers. Ornithomimosaurs, we've mentioned, they had feathers, and so did\na whole bunch of other groups as well. There's about eight or nine major groups, kind of the size of\nsomething like, yeah, literally like carnivores or deer. You know, some massive groups. About eight or nine\nof them were fully feathered, as far as we can tell. So feathers\nmassively predate bird origins, but it was a major\npart of their evolution. - Do I understand why feathers\nevolved with the function, the, the sexual selection, the signaling? - Yeah, it's probably a fundamental\ntwofold one, which is feathers insulate you. They keep you\nwarm. And most dinosaurs were, it's an archaic term, but it's what most\npeople know, warm-blooded. So they were much more like us and birds. They had a\nstable high body temperature regardless of the environmental conditions. So if you're\nburning a lot of calories to stay warm, you want to kind of keep that heat,\nand feathers really help you do that. And then the other thing is, yeah,\nthe obvious thing is sexual selection and communication. Feathers do\nstuff that scales can't. You can shed them in winter and change color\nand come back as another one. That's quite a handy trick. You can change them\nbetween juveniles and adults. So baby birds have one type of feather, adults\nhave a different one. We know of dinosaurs that do that, where we've got adults and\njuveniles with different feather types preserved in the fossils. Yeah, you\ncan produce all kinds of weird colors and displays. You can erect feathers.\nYou can hold them up and fan them out like a peacock or a pheasant. Whereas\nscales, you can't really do that, or you need a huge amount of\nbone like Protoceratops. So there's two good reasons that\nthey would probably evolve, and exactly pulling them apart or which\nis more important. And again- they're probably bifunctional. As soon\nas you start making feathers and making them more colorful, well, you're staying\nwarmer. So that's an advantage. Or as soon as you start making feathers to make them\nwarmer, it probably won't be long until someone evolves them to be a bit brighter red.\nAnd then we're back to, \"Oh my God, red.\" Right? But that's what's happening. And then they're probably gonna\npush each other potentially. - I mean, it is true that the\nbirds went real crazy with the feather and the colors and\nthe prettiness and all that. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. They absolutely do. - I mean, maybe there's something about\nfeathers that allows for that efficient sort of diversification of fashion. - I think, yeah, I think it gives\nthem opportunities that... ...scales and solid\nstructures simply don't. - Yeah, it could be a material for it. - The sole ability, I mean, I say peacocks\nand pheasants, they are at a massive disadvantage, and males have got these extra\nplumes because they're so big and heavy. Peacocks can barely fly. But the fact is,\nyou can still kind of fold them up into a fairly neat package and kind of hide if\nyou really wanted to. Whereas if you're something like a Triceratops, that\nbillboard stuck on the top of your head is not only enormous but also bone. It's massive, it's\nheavy, and you've got to... - No hiding. - ...hide it around the whole year. Whereas\npeacocks at least can go, \"Well, all the girls have settled down on their nests now,\nI'm just going to get rid of all this extra weight and dump it.\" - Just looking at the entire history\nof Earth, what has studying hundreds of millions of\nyears of evolution, studying this epic age of the dinosaurs,\nwhat has that done for your appreciation of what makes Earth\nbeautiful? Do you ever just like sit back and think, \"Holy shit,\nthis is incredible, this whole thing\"? - Yeah, yeah, I do. But I guess maybe\nnot much more so than I would anyway. As in, I already... because\nagain, I don't really think of myself as a paleontologist\nin a lot of ways. Um, it's not that I don't\nlove my work, but it's, I'm a biologist, and this is what I'm\nlooking at. But I'm fascinated and amazed by lungfish and flying frogs and caterpillars and onychophorans and\nbutterflies and a million and one other hagfish and things that I think are cool\nand interesting and fascinating, and I could happily read about them or watch\nthem in a zoo or a documentary or whatever it may be,\nalmost every bit as much as I would with dinosaurs. I probably\nappreciate the dinosaurs and pterosaurs in a very different way because I have\nsuch a greater intimate knowledge of the science, in a way that I try and read\nthe lion literature because I'm really interested in predation dynamics, but I can't\nkeep up with it whilst doing all the other stuff as well. - Predation dynamics. Awesome. - Well, right, so like the difference of\nwhat prey are they taking? Why? At what percentage? What influences? How are\nthey competing with leopards and... - Wait, there's a body\nof literature on this? - Yeah, people are studying lions, what they\nhunt, what they eat, and where they do it, and there's a whole bunch of\nstuff on particularly the African carnivores, because there are so\nmany of them and they're so big, and their populations aren't\nterrible compared to like South America or North America or\na lot of Asia, for example. Um, But yeah, going back to your question,\nI can appreciate all of it. It's all cool. Some of it is definitely more\nawesome than others. I work on some of the giant pterosaurs, the\nones with 10-meter wingspans. Yeah, and it's, it's hard. My\npartner's family is from Uganda. We were in Uganda last year.\nI was watching marabou storks circle overhead and you're like, \"Wow,\nthese things are huge and amazing.\" And then I'm like, \"Their wingspan is\nabout a fifth of the stuff I work on.\" Their wingspan is about a\nfifth of the stuff I work on.\" Actually, these are quite piddly\nin the grand scheme, you know, this thing being like an airliner going\noverhead. And when you think about it in that context, yeah, I mean, because that's it with the... you know, I\nknow people tend to be obsessed with size. You kind of get it.\nLike blue whales are... fundamentally cooler than smaller humpback\nwhales, even if humpback whales are cool. It's hard not to be\nimpressed by Patagotitan or Tyrannosaurus or Triceratops or\nQuetzalcoatlus or any of these ultimate giants. There's a reason we love\ngreat white sharks, there's a reason we love giant squid. There's a reason we love\nlions and grizzly bears and stuff. But the dinosaurs do kind of\ndo it better than anyone else or, you know, marine reptiles and the flying\nreptiles, because it's just so insane. - Yeah, both size and diversity. - Yeah, and longevity as\nwell. I mean, you look at, you know, elephants have\ncome and gone, and the whales, okay, the whales have reached superlative\nsizes, but they're relatively new on the scene. Could easily have\ngone extinct in the last century. But yeah, you know, there's truly titanic dinosaurs for at\nleast 100 million years. - It's a long time. It's hard sometimes,\nand as you said, it's very hard to load in just how long that is. They really\ndominated Earth for a very long time. - Yeah, and almost absolutely everywhere.\nThere's a handful of places that we've found where it appears that dinosaurs\ndidn't really get in, and something else kind of took over, you know, like\nAustralia with the marsupials versus the other eutherians. But yeah, fundamentally,\nit was a dinosaur planet for... After the Triassic, less so the end of the\nTriassic when they're first getting going. But yeah, Jurassic and Cretaceous,\nyeah, it's 140-ish million years of, yeah, just absolute dominance. - I think it's hilarious and just\nperfect that there's a giant dinosaur head next to you, and you didn't\nmention it once during this conversation. - Because I thought we'd get it. Well, I\nmean, giant is an absolute diddy one. Yeah, so this is Protoceratops\nandrewsi. I've done loads of work on Protoceratops. It's\nfrom Mongolia. This is a latest so I've got a big head, and the big\nhead's kind of like this, but I really but I really couldn't fit it in the bag. - So this is a to-scale juvenile. - This is a cast. This is\nnot original, but someone has molded and copied it. So\nit's not even, it's not carved. It's a cast and a mold taken. So yeah, this is 100% accurate to the original specimen,\nor at least extraordinarily accurate to the original specimen. - So it's a young guy. - Yeah. But yeah, at full\nsize, it's going to be like pig or sheep size, so big but not massive. But I've got it partly because it's\naffordable, cause I can't afford to buy the big skeletons and skulls. But I've done\na huge amount of work on it, and in part it goes back to those\nearlier conversations about populations. If you really want\nto understand animals, you need an understanding of what\na real population and a growth of what these\nanimals looks like. And Protoceratops is, I would argue,\nprobably the only dinosaur where we can really do that, or\nat least as close as possible as you could get to any modern\nanimal as an analog. We've got well over 100 good skeletons, though probably only about 70 or\n80 in really accessible museums, but that's still a hell of a lot.\nWe have everything from, \"Here's a tiny baby one.\" This is a really cheap\nand nasty 3D print I had made but that's a hatchling sized\none, or not much bigger than a hatchling sized one, all the way up to the big adults.\nWe've now got embryos as well, which we didn't have until\nabout 10 years ago. So we've got embryonic animals all the\nway up to big adults. They're all pretty much from one place in Mongolia. And they are, as far as\nwe can tell, from a relatively narrow window in time, only about 100,000 years,\nwhich in the grand scheme of things is very close. So you've got one population from one\nplace from one time, with 100 animals from embryos up to big adults. - That's okay. - So now if you want to look at,\nas I do, something like sexual selection, and when does growth of\nthe signal kick in and at what size, and what evidence for dimorphism, well,\nsuddenly you've got a population. You've got something you can work\nwith. And that's why Protoceratops is so important,\nand I think way more important than even a lot of my fellow paleontologists\nrealize, and I genuinely think we should be pouring a lot more research\ninto them, because they can tell us stuff that pretty much\nno other dinosaur can. - Because you have the\npopulation data, so you can... ...you can ask them a lot more questions. - And we can treat it as a population.\nSo going way, way back to a conversation about telling males and\nfemales apart, and I said the big problem is population data,\nor at least the number of specimens that you have when mostly\nyou've only got one, two, or three. I did a big study on this a few years\nago on gharials, the really long-snouted crocodilians from Nepal, India,\nand Pakistan with a giant bulge on the end of the nose. And even\nthough the males are all bigger than the females, and the males all\nhave this weird nose growth that's mostly soft tissue, but they have\na weird depression in the jaw, in the end of the snout where the\nnostrils sit. We got a sample size of something like about 110\nanimals. So these are very, very rare animals, so we had to\nransack every museum worldwide. I was sending my students sending\nemails to huge numbers of people, \"Have you got one sitting in\nyour collection lost? Can you get it for us? Can you take these photos or these\nmeasurements? We can measure it.\" We put the dataset together, and then we found\nthat actually, apart from the very biggest males, it's\nreally hard to tell males and females apart, and this\nactually really closely matched some modeling data that I'd done with\na colleague, Jordan Malin in Ottawa, looking at this for alligators\nand trying to compare it to dinosaurs. Because we talked about\nmutual sexual selection before, neutral sexual selection in particular, you\ntend to get things that are extremely similar. Males and females are very hard\nto tell apart. But there's also a gradient, you know,\nall the way up to things like peacocks, all the way down to you\ncan't tell them apart, like parrots. And for some features, when\nthey take time to get growing, or because dinosaurs grow over\na very long window and are sexually mature over a very long\nwindow, you run into the problem that a big female will look like a small male. And we can't sex them, and lo and behold,\nthis is what you get with the gharials. The really big males are obvious because they're so\nmuch bigger and they've got this big depression in the snout, but medium-sized and\nbig females look like medium sized, or smaller males and\nvery small males. And so, yeah, that's basically what we have with\ndinosaurs. Even with Protoceratops, where we've got a dataset of like a hundred, papers have come out saying there's very\nmild sexual dimorphism or there isn't sexual dimorphism. Sexual dimorphism could be very strong in Protoceratops,\nbut we can't find it because we can't tell the males from the\nfemales because we haven't ID'd enough through something\nlike medullary bone. And so you're in this horrible situation where,\nbecause going back to the T-Rex thing, is like well, maybe it's mutual sexual selection\nand therefore they're cooperating, and that would be cool. But also,\nmaybe males are much bigger but we can't tell because\nour dataset's too small. - Oh, that's frustrating. - In which case, they're not under mutual\nsexual selection, and we've got it all wrong. Argh! It- It's maddening because it's so if these were living animals, you'd just\nwatch them or you'd just genotype them or you'd sex them and you'd\njust know, and we just don't. But on the other hand, we do\nhave the mechanism to do it. There are a handful of places where you get a bunch\nof Protoceratops together, where it's a mass mortality site. Well, let's go and\ndrill every bone, because if that's the breeding season, we might find seven or\neight females, and then the others are pretty much by default males if we know it's the\nmiddle of the breeding season because all the middle of the breeding season because\nall the others have medullary bone. Now, let's analyze those two data sets. And then maybe we'll see a\ndifference and maybe we won't. - I love how that frustration is\na catalyst for figuring it out. You're searching for a place, a piece of\nevidence that just shows you clearly. - There are ways in. - Yeah, there's ways in. - This is the thing. - There's always ways in. - Yeah, there are ways in. And\nmaybe we got to get lucky because maybe it's not\nthe breeding season. Or maybe that was just a group\nof all males, and therefore we're not going to get the\nsignal we're looking for. But there's enough of them, and they're\ncommon enough, and yet, still digging in Mongolia, we keep finding new species.\nWe keep finding new, cooler stuff. But I'm like, \"Can we dig up\nsome more Protoceratops?\" Because actually, however\ncool these new things are, genuinely, if you want to know what\ndinosaurs are and how they worked, another hundred Protoceratops will\nactually probably tell us a lot more than 50 new species, however\ncool 50 new species might be. - Paleontology is an incredible\ndiscipline. It really is Sherlock Holmes territory. This was an incredible conversation. I'm really grateful\nfor all the work you write, that you put out there. - Thank you. - The podcast is incredible. I\njust, thank you for being you and thank you for talking today. - Well, thank you very much for having\nme. I hope I haven't worn out my welcome with dinosaur... - No. - stories. - Oh, we could talk for many more hours.\nThank you, brother.
